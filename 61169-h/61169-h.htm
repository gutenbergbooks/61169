<p>SIR,</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="fsize200">E</span>very work that tends to enlarge the
boundaries of science has a peculiar claim
to the protection of Kings. He that diffuses
science, civilizes man, opens the inlets
to his happiness, and co-operates with the
Fountain and Source of all knowledge. By<span class="pagenum" id="Pagevi">[vi]</span>
science truth is advanced; and of <span class="smcap">Divine
Truth</span> Kings are the representatives.</p>

<p>The work which I have now the honour
to present to YOUR MAJESTY, calls the
attention of the reader to those laws of
Divine order by which the universe is governed
and supported; in it we find that the
minutest beings share in the protection, and
triumph in the bounty of the Sovereign of
all things: that the infinitely small manifest
to the astonished eye the same proportion,
regularity and design, which are conspicuous
to the unassisted sight in the larger parts of
creation. By finding all things formed in<span class="pagenum" id="Pagevii">[vii]</span>
beauty, and produced for use, the mind is
raised from the fleeting and evanescent appearances
of matter, to contemplate the
permanent principles of truth, and acknowledge
that the whole proceeds from the
wisdom that originates in love.</p>

<p>It was by YOUR MAJESTY&#8217;S goodness
and gracious patronage that I was first induced
to undertake a description of mathematical
and philosophical instruments, that
I might thereby facilitate the attainment of
those sciences that are connected with them,
and by shewing what was already obtained,
excite emulation, and quicken invention.</p>

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="startcapital">I</span>n the preface to my
<span class="smcap">Essays on Electricity and Magnetism</span>,
I informed the public that it was my intention to publish, from
time to time, essays describing the construction and explaining
the use of mathematical and philosophical instruments, in their
present state of improvement. This work will, I hope, be considered
as a performance of my promise, as far as relates to the
subject here treated of.<a href="#Footnote1" id="FNanchor1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pagex">[x]</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote1"><a href="#FNanchor1" class="label">[1]</a>
Towards the completion of this design, our author afterwards published, 1. Astronomical
and Geographical Essays; 2. Geometrical and Graphical Essays; 3. An Essay on Vision;
4. Lectures on Natural and Experimental Philosophy. He had projected other compilations,
and was preparing a new edition of this work; but, alas! how uncertain are all human projects!
constant attention to an extensive business and to literature, preyed on a constitution far from
robust, and at length rapidly accelerated his dissolution, which happened at Southampton, on the
14th of August, 1795; aged 45. By this event, the world was prematurely deprived of the
beneficial effects of his farther labours, and his friends of the conversation of a man, whose
amiable and communicative disposition endeared him to all those who had the pleasure of
knowing him. His life had been devoted to religious and moral duties, to the acquisition of
science, and its diffusion for the benefit of mankind. To those who had no personal knowledge
of Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>, his works will continue to display his merits as an author, and his virtues as a
valuable member of society. <span class="smcap">Edit.</span></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The <a href="#Page1">first chapter</a> contains a short history of the invention and
improvements that have been made on the microscope, and Father
Di Torre&#8217;s method of making his celebrated glass globules. The
<a href="#Page26">second</a> treats of vision, in which I have endeavoured to explain
in a familiar manner the reason of those advantages which are
obtained by the use of magnifying lenses; but as the reader is
supposed to be unacquainted with the elements of this science,
so many intermediate ideas have been necessarily omitted, as
must in some degree lessen the force, and weaken the perception
of the truths intended to be inculcated: to have given these,
would have required a treatise on optics.</p>

<p>In the <a href="#Page64">third chapter</a>, the most improved microscopes, and some
others which are in general use, are particularly described; no
pains have been spared to lessen the difficulty of observation, and
remove obscurity from description; the relative advantages of
each instrument are briefly pointed out, to enable the reader to
select that which is best adapted to his pursuits. The method of
preparing different objects for observation, and the cautions necessary
to be observed in the use of the microscope, are the subjects
of the <a href="#Page129">fourth chapter</a>.</p>

<p>When I first undertook the present essays, I had confined
myself to a re-publication of my fathers work, entitled, Micrographia
Illustrata; but I soon found that both his and Mr. Baker&#8217;s
tracts on the microscope were very imperfect. Natural history
had not been so much cultivated at the period when they wrote,
as it is in the present day. To the want of that information
which is now easily obtained, we may with propriety impute
their errors and imperfections. I have, therefore, in the <a href="#Page167">fifth
chapter</a>, after some general observations on the utility of natural
history, endeavoured to remedy their defects, by arranging the
subject in systematic order, and by introducing the microscopic<span class="pagenum" id="Pagexi">[xi]</span>
reader to the system of Linn&aelig;us, as far as relates to insects: by
this he will learn to discriminate one insect from another, to
characterize their different parts, and thus be better enabled to
avoid error himself, and to convey instruction to others.</p>

<p>As the transformations which insects undergo, constitute a
principal branch of their history, and furnish many objects for
the microscope, I have given a very ample description of them;
the more so, as many microscopic writers, by not considering
these changes with attention, have fallen into a variety of mistakes.
Here I intended to stop; but the charms of natural history
are so seducing, that I was led on to describe the peculiar
and striking marks in the &#339;conomy of these little creatures.
And should the purchaser of these essays receive as much pleasure
in reading this part as I did in compiling it; should it induce him
to study this part of natural history; nay, should it only lead him
to read the stupendous work of the most excellent Swammerdam,
he will have no reason to regret his purchase, and one of my
warmest wishes will be gratified.</p>

<p>In the <a href="#Page334">next chapter</a> I have endeavoured to give the reader
some idea of the internal parts of insects, principally from
M. Lyonet&#8217;s Anatomical and Microscopical Description of the
Caterpillar of the Cossus or Goat-moth. As this book is but little
known in our country, I concluded that a specimen of the indefatigable
labour of this patient and humane anatomist would be
acceptable to all lovers of the microscope; and I have, therefore,
appropriated a <a href="#Plate12">plate</a>, which, whilst it shews what may be effected
when microscopic observation is accompanied by patience and
industry, displays also the wonderful organization of this insect.
This is followed by a description of several miscellaneous objects,
of which no proper idea could be formed without the assistance
of glasses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pagexii">[xii]</span></p>

<p>To describe the fresh-water polype or hydra; to give a short
history of the discovery of these curious animals, and some account
of their singular properties, is the business of the <a href="#Page357">succeeding
chapter</a>. The properties of these animals are so extraordinary,
that they were considered at first to be as contrary to the
common course of nature, as they really were to the received
opinions of animal life. Indeed, who can even now contemplate
without astonishment animals that multiply by slips and shoots
like a plant? that may be grafted together as one tree to another,
that may be turned inside out like a glove, and yet live, act, and
perform all the various functions of their contracted spheres? As
nearly allied to these, the chapter finishes with an account of
those vorticell&aelig; which have been enumerated by Linn&aelig;us. It has
been my endeavour to dissipate confusion by the introduction of
order, to dispose into method, and select under proper heads the
substance of all that is known relative to these little creatures,
and in the compass of a few pages to give the reader the information
that is dispersed through volumes.</p>

<p>From the hydr&aelig; and vorticell&aelig;, it was natural to proceed to
the animalcula which are to be found in vegetable infusions;
microscopic beings, that seem as it were to border on the infinitely
small, that leave no space destitute of inhabitants, and are
of greater importance in the immense scale of beings than our
contracted imagination can conceive; yet, small as they are, each
of them possesses all that beauty and proportion of organized
texture which is necessary to its well-being, and suited to the
happiness it is called forth to enjoy. A <a href="#Page415">short account</a> of three
hundred and seventy-seven<a href="#Footnote2" id="FNanchor2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of these minute beings is then given,
agreeable to the system of the laborious M&uuml;ller, enlarging considerably
his description of those animalcula that are most easily<span class="pagenum" id="Pagexiii">[xiii]</span>
met with, better known, and consequently more interesting to
the generality of readers.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote2"><a href="#FNanchor2" class="label">[2]</a> To these, six more are now added,
making the whole three hundred and eighty three. <span class="smcap">Edit.</span></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The construction of timber, and the disposition of its component
parts, as seen by the microscope, is the subject of the <a href="#Page574">next
chapter</a>; a subject confessedly obscure. With what degree of
success this attempt has been prosecuted, must be left to the
judgment of the reader. The best treatise on this part of vegetation
is that of M. Du Hamel du Monceau sur la Physique
des Arbres. If either my time or situation in life would have
permitted it, I should have followed his plan; but being confined
to business and to London, I can only recommend it to those
lovers of the works of the Almighty, who live in the country, to
pursue this important branch of natural history. There is no
doubt but that new views of the operations in nature, and of the
wisdom with which all things are contrived, would amply repay
the labour of investigation. Every part of the vegetable kingdom
is rich in microscopic beauties, from the stateliest tree of the
forest, from the cedar of Lebanon, to the lowliest moss and the
hyssop that springeth out of the wall; all conspiring to say how
much is hid from the natural sight of man, how little can be
known till it receives assistance, and is benefited by adventitious
aid.</p>

<p>From the wonderful organization of animals, and the curious
texture of vegetables, we proceed to the mineral kingdom, and
take a cursory <a href="#Page600">view</a> of the configuration of salts and saline substances,
exhibiting a few specimens of the beautiful order in
which they arrange themselves under the eye, after having been
separated by dissolution; every species working as it were upon
a different plan, and producing cubes, pyramids, hexagons, or
some other figure peculiar to itself, with a constant regularity
amidst boundless variety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pagexiv">[xiv]</span></p>

<p>Though all nature teems with objects for the microscopic
observer, yet such is the indolence of the human mind, or such
its inattention to what is obvious, that among the purchasers of
microscopes many have complained that they knew not what
subjects to apply to their instrument, or where to find objects for
examination. To obviate this complaint, a <a href="#Page665">catalogue</a> is here
given, which is interspersed with the description of a few insects,
and other objects, which could not be conveniently introduced in
the foregoing chapters. By this catalogue it is hoped that the
use of the microscope will be extended, and the path of observation
facilitated.</p>

<p>To avoid the formal parade of quotation, and the fastidious
charge of plagiarism, I have subjoined to this preface a <a href="#Pagexv">list</a> of the
authors which have been consulted. As my extracts were made
at very distant periods, it would have been impossible for me to
recollect to whom I was indebted for every new fact or ingenious
observation.</p>

<p>The <a href="#Plate1">plates</a> were drawn and engraved with a view to be folded
up with the work; but as it is the opinion of many of my friends
that they would, by this mean, be materially injured, I have been
advised to have them stitched in strong blue paper, and leave it
to the purchaser to dispose of them to his own mind.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i><span class="startcapital">T</span>he editor esteems
it his indispensable duty, to point out the several improvements
which have been made in this work, in order to render it still more
acceptable to the public.</i></p>

<p><i>The whole has been carefully revised&mdash;many typographical errors corrected&mdash;numerous
additions and emendations from the author&#8217;s own copy incorporated,
and some superfluities rejected. Wherever any ambiguity occurred, the
editor has endeavoured to elucidate the passage, observing due caution not to
misconceive the idea which the author meant to inculcate. A more regular
arrangement has been attempted, and occasional notes subjoined: in these, and
in other parts of the work, it has been the editor&#8217;s primary object to ascertain
facts, not to decide peremptorily. Should he in any instance have erred, he
can assure the candid critic, that he shall experience a most sensible pleasure
in conviction.</i></p>

<p class="highline2"><i>The principal additions are</i>,</p>

<p class="ind24">Accounts of the latest improvements which have been made in the
construction of microscopes, particularly the lucernal.</p>

<p class="ind24">A description of the glass, pearl, &amp;c. micrometers, as made by Mr. Coventry,
and others.</p>

<p class="ind24">An arrangement and description of minute and rare shells.</p>

<p class="ind24">A descriptive list of a variety of vegetable seeds.</p>

<p class="ind24">Instructions for collecting and preserving insects, together with directions
for forming a cabinet.</p>

<p class="ind24">A copious list of objects for the microscope.</p>

<p class="ind24">A list of Mr. Custance&#8217;s fine vegetable cuttings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pagexx">[xx]</span></p>

<p class="blankbefore1"><i>With respect to the plates, three new engravings are introduced, viz.</i></p>

<table class="plates" summary="Plates">

<td class="shows">Exhibiting the most improved compound microscopes, with

</table>

<p class="blankbefore1"><i>Many additional figures have been inserted in other plates, and a number
of errors in the references corrected.</i></p>

<p><i>A complete list of the plates and a more extensive index are also added.</i></p>

<p><i>It has been generally understood, that the author intended to have published
this edition in octavo; but, the impropriety of adopting that mode must appear
evident, for the very reason assigned by the author himself in the concluding part
of his preface. If the plates are liable to sustain damage by folding them into a
quarto, they would have been subjected to far greater injury by being doubled
into an octavo size, besides, being extremely incommodious for reference. As the
work now appears, the purchaser may either retain the plates in the separate
volume, or, without much inconvenience, if properly guarded, have them bound
with the letter press.</i></p>

<p><i>It affords the editor a pleasing satisfaction to mention, that notwithstanding
the additional heavy expense incurred in the article of paper, &amp;c. yet, by somewhat
enlarging the page, and other economical regulations in the mode of
printing, this edition is offered to the public at a trifling advance on the
original price, though the improvements now made occupy considerably more
than one-hundred pages.</i></p>

<p><i>Anxious, lest the reputation which the work has already acquired, should be
diminished by any deficiency on his part, the editor has sedulously applied
himself to render it extensively useful to the serious admirer of the wonders of
the creation; whether he has succeeded, is now submitted to the decision of the
intelligent part of the public. He shall only add, that conscious of the purity
of his intentions, and convinced of the instability of all terrestrial attainments,
he trusts that he is equally secured from the weakness of being elevated by
success, or depressed by disappointment.</i></p>

<span class="chapname">A CONCISE HISTORY OF THE INVENTION AND IMPROVEMENTS
WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE UPON THE INSTRUMENT CALLED
A MICROSCOPE.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="startcapital">I</span>t is generally supposed that
microscopes<a href="#Footnote3" id="FNanchor3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> were invented about
the year 1580, a period fruitful in discoveries; a time when the
mind began to emancipate itself from those errors and prejudices
by which it had been too long enslaved, to assert its rights, extend
its powers, and follow the paths which lead to truth. The honor
of the invention is claimed by the Italians and the Dutch; the
name of the inventor, however, is lost; probably the discovery
did not at first appear sufficiently important, to engage the attention
of those men, who, by their reputation in science, were able<span class="pagenum" id="Page2">[2]</span>
to establish an opinion of its merit with the rest of the world, and
hand down the name of the inventor to succeeding ages. Men
of great literary abilities are too apt to despise the first dawnings
of invention, not considering that all real knowledge is progressive,
and that what they deem trifling, may be the first and necessary
link to a new branch of science.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote3"><a href="#FNanchor3" class="label">[3]</a>
The term microscope is derived from the Greek &#956;&#953;&#954;&#961;&#959;&#962;
little, and &#963;&#954;&#959;&#960;&#949;&#969; to view; it is a
dioptric instrument, by means of which objects invisible to the naked eye, or very minute, are
by the assistance of lenses, or mirrors, represented exceeding large and very distinct. <span class="smcap">Edit.</span></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The microscope extends the boundaries of the organs of vision;
enables us to examine the structure of plants and animals; presents
to the eye myriads of beings, of whose existence we had before
formed no idea; opens to the curious an exhaustless source of
information and pleasure; and furnishes the philosopher with an
unlimited field of investigation. &#8220;It leads,&#8221; to use the words of an
ingenious writer, &#8220;to the discovery of a thousand wonders in the
works of his hand, who created ourselves, as well as the objects
of our admiration; it improves the faculties, exalts the comprehension,
and multiplies the inlets to happiness; is a new source of
praise to him, to whom all we pay is nothing of what we owe;
and, while it pleases the imagination with the unbounded treasures
it offers to the view, it tends to make the whole life one
continued act of admiration.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is not difficult to fix the period when the microscope first
began to be generally known, and was used for the purpose of
examining minute objects; for, though we are ignorant of the
name of the first inventor, we are acquainted with the names of
those who introduced it to the public, and engaged their attention
to it, by exhibiting some of its wonderful effects. Zacharias
Jansens and his son had made microscopes before the year
1619, for in that year the ingenious Cornelius Drebell brought
one, which was made by them, with him into England, and
shewed it to William Borel, and others. It is possible, this instrument
of Drebell&#8217;s was not strictly what is now meant by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page3">[3]</span>
microscope, but was rather a kind of microscopic telescope,<a href="#Footnote4" id="FNanchor4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> something
similar in principle to that lately described by Mr. &AElig;pinus,
in a letter to the Academy of Sciences at Petersburgh. It was
formed of a copper tube six feet long and one inch diameter, supported
by three brass pillars in the shape of dolphins; these were
fixed to a base of ebony, on which the objects to be viewed
by the microscope were also placed. In contradiction to this,
Fontana, in a work which he published in 1646, says, that he had
made microscopes in the year 1618: this may be also very true,
without derogating from the merit of the Jansens, for we have
many instances in our own times of more than one person having
executed the same contrivance, nearly at the same time, without any
communication from one to the other.<a href="#Footnote5" id="FNanchor5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> In 1685, Stelluti published
a description of the parts of a bee, which he had examined
with a microscope.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote4"><a href="#FNanchor4" class="label">[4]</a> Vide Borellum de vero Telescopii Inventore.</p>

<p id="Footnote5"><a href="#FNanchor5" class="label">[5]</a> In 1664
Dr. Power published his &#8220;Experimental Philosophy,&#8221; the first part of which consists
of a variety of microscopical observations; and in the following year Dr. Hooke produced
his &#8220;Micrographia,&#8221; illustrated with a number of elegant
figures of the different objects. <span class="smcap">Edit.</span></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>If we consider the microscope as an instrument consisting of
one lens only, it is not at all improbable that it was known to
the ancients much sooner than the last century; nay, even in a
degree to the Greeks and Romans: for it is certain, that spectacles
were in use long before the above-mentioned period: now, as the
glasses of these were made of different convexities, and consequently
of different magnifying powers, it is natural to suppose,
that smaller and more convex lenses were made, and applied to
the examination of minute objects. In this sense, there is also
some ground for thinking the ancients were not ignorant of the
use of lenses, or at least of what approached nearly to, and might
in some instances be substituted for them. The two principal reasons
which support this opinion are, first, the minuteness of some<span class="pagenum" id="Page4">[4]</span>
ancient pieces of workmanship, which are to be met with in the
cabinets of the curious: the parts of some of these are so small,
that it does not appear at present how they could have been executed
without the use of magnifying glasses, or of what use they
could have been when executed, unless they were in possession of
glasses to examine them with. A remarkable piece of this kind,
a seal with very minute work, and which to the naked eye appears
very confused and indistinct, but beautiful when examined with a
proper lense, is described &#8220;Dans l&#8217;Histoire de l&#8217;Academie des Inscriptions,&#8221;
tom. 1, p. 333. The second argument is founded on
a great variety of passages, that are to be seen in the works of
Jamblichus, Pliny, Plutarch, Seneca, Agellius, Pisidias, &amp;c. From
these passages it is evident that they were enabled by some instrument,
or other means, not only to view distant objects, but also to
magnify small ones; for, if this is not admitted, the passages appear
absurd, and not capable of having a rational meaning applied to
them. I shall only adduce a short passage from Pisidias, a christian
writer of the seventh century, &#932;&#945; &#956;&#949;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;
&#969;&#962; &#948;&#953;&#945; &#948;&#953;&#959;&#960;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#965;
&#963;&#965; &#946;&#955;&#949;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#962;: &#8220;You see things future by a <i>dioptrum</i>:&#8221; now we
know of nothing but a perspective glass or small telescope, whereby
things at a distance may be seen as if they were near at hand,
the circumstance on which the simile was founded. It is also
clear, that they were acquainted with, and did make use of that
kind of microscope, which is even at this day commonly sold in
our streets by the Italian pedlars, namely, a glass bubble filled
with water. Seneca plainly affirms it, <i>Liter&aelig;, quamvis minut&aelig;
et obscur&aelig;, per vitream pilam aqua plenam majores clarioresque
cernuntur</i>. Nat. Qu&aelig;st. lib. 1, cap. 7. &#8220;Letters, though minute
and obscure, appear larger and clearer through a glass bubble
filled with water.&#8221; Those who wish to see further evidence concerning
the knowledge of the ancients in optics, may consult
Smith&#8217;s Optics, Dr. Priestley&#8217;s History of Light and Colours, the
Appendix to an Essay on the first Principles of Natural Philosophy<span class="pagenum" id="Page5">[5]</span>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The history of the microscope, like that of nations and arts,
has had its brilliant periods, in which it has shone with uncommon
splendor, and been cultivated with extraordinary ardour;
these have been succeeded by intervals marked with no discovery,
and in which the science seemed to fade away, or at least lie dormant,
till some favourable circumstance, the discovery of a new
object, or some new improvement in the instruments of observation,
awakened the attention of the curious, and animated their
researches. Thus, soon after the invention of the microscope, the
field it presented to observation was cultivated by men of the first
rank in science, who enriched almost every branch of natural history
by the discoveries they made with this instrument: there is
indeed scarce any object so inconsiderable, that has not something
to invite the curious eye to examine it; nor is there any,
which, when properly examined, will not amply repay the trouble
of investigation.</p>

<p>I shall first speak of the <span class="smcapall">SINGLE MICROSCOPE</span>, not only as it is
the most simple, but because, as we have already observed, it was
invented and used long before the double or compound microscope.
When the lenses of the single microscope are very convex, and
consequently the magnifying power very great, the field of view
is so small, and it is so difficult to adjust with accuracy their focal
distance, that it requires some practice to render the use thereof
familiar; at the same time, the smallness of the aperture to these
lenses has been found injurious to the eyes of some observers:<span class="pagenum" id="Page6">[6]</span>
notwithstanding, however, these defects, the great magnifying
power, as well as the distinct vision which is obtained by the use
of a deep single lens, more than counterbalances every difficulty
and disadvantage. It was with this instrument that Leeuwenhoek
and Swammerdam, Lyonet and Ellis examined the minima
of nature, laid open some of her hidden recesses, and by their example
stimulated others to the same pursuit.</p>

<p>The construction of the single microscope is so simple, that it
is susceptible of but little improvement, and has therefore undergone
but few alterations; and these have been chiefly confined to
the mode of mounting it, or the additions to its apparatus. The
greatest improvement this instrument has received, was made by
Dr. Lieberk&uuml;hn, about the year 1740; it consisted in placing the
small lens in the center of a highly polished concave speculum of
silver, by which means he was enabled to reflect a strong light
upon the upper surface of an object, and thus examine it with
great ease and pleasure. Before this contrivance, it was almost
impossible to examine small opake objects with any degree of exactness
and satisfaction; for the dark side of the object being next
the eye, and also overshadowed by the proximity of the instrument,
its appearance was necessarily obscure and indistinct.</p>

<p>Dr. Lieberk&uuml;hn adapted a microscope to every object; it
consisted of a short brass tube, at the eye end of which a concave
silver speculum was fixed, and in the center of the speculum a
magnifying lens: the object was placed in the middle of the tube,
and had a small adjustment to regulate it to the focus; at the
other end of the tube there was a plano convex lens, to condense
and render more uniform the light which was reflected from the
mirror. But all these pains were not bestowed upon trifling objects;
his were generally the most curious anatomical preparations,
a few of which, with their microscopes, are, I believe, deposited<span class="pagenum" id="Page7">[7]</span>
in the British Museum. It will be proper, in this place,
to give some account of Mr. Leeuwenhoek&#8217;s microscopes, which
were rendered famous throughout all Europe, on account of the
numerous discoveries he had made with them, as well as from his
afterwards bequeathing a part of them to the Royal Society. The
microscopes he used were all single, and fitted up in a convenient
simple manner; each of them consisted of a very small double
convex lens, let into a socket between two plates rivetted together,
and pierced with a small hole; the object was placed on a
silver point or needle, which, by means of screws adapted for
that purpose, might be turned about, raised or depressed at pleasure,
and thus be brought nearer to, or be removed farther from the
glass, as the eye of the observer, the nature of the object, and the
convenient examination of its parts required. Mr. Leeuwenhoek
fixed his objects, if they were solid, to the foregoing point with
glue; if they were fluid, he fitted them on a little plate of talc,
or exceeding thin blown glass, which he afterwards glued to the
needle, in the same manner as his other objects. The glasses
were all exceeding clear, and of different magnifying powers,
which were proportioned to the nature of the object, and the
parts designed to be examined. But none of those, which were
presented to the Royal Society, magnify so much as the glass globules,
which have been used in other microscopes. He had observed,
in a letter of his to the Royal Society, that from upwards
of forty years experience, he found that the most considerable
discoveries were to be made with such glasses, as magnifying but
moderately, exhibited the object with the most perfect brightness
and distinctness. Each instrument was devoted to one or two
objects: hence he had always some hundreds by him.<a href="#Footnote7" id="FNanchor7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> There is
some reason for supposing, that Leeuwenhoek was acquainted<span class="pagenum" id="Page8">[8]</span>
with a mode of viewing opake objects, similar to that invented
by Dr. Lieberk&uuml;hn.<a href="#Footnote8" id="FNanchor8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>About the year 1665, small glass globules began to be occasionally
applied to the single microscope, instead of convex lenses.
By these globules, an immense magnifying power is obtained.
The invention of them has been generally attributed to M. Hartsoeker;
it appears, however, to me, that we are indebted to the
celebrated Dr. Hooke for this discovery; for he described the
manner of making them in the preface to his &#8220;Micrographia,&#8221;
which was published in the year 1665. Now the first account
we have of any microscopical discovery by M. Hartsoeker, was
that of the spermatic animalcul&aelig;, made by him when he was
eighteen years old; which brings us down to the year 1674, long
after Dr. Hooke&#8217;s publication.</p>

<p>As these glass globules have been very useful in the hands of
experienced observers, I shall lay before my readers the different
modes which have been described for making them, that the
reader may be enabled thereby to ascertain the reality of the discoveries
that have been said to be made with them.</p>

<p>Take a small rod<a href="#Footnote9" id="FNanchor9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> of the clearest and cleanest glass you can
procure, free, if possible from blebs, veins, or sandy particles;
then by melting it in a lamp with spirit of wine, or the purest
and clearest sallad oil, draw it out into exceeding fine and
small threads; take a small piece of these threads, and melt the
end thereof in the same flame, till you perceive it run into a small
drop, or globule, of the desired size; let this globule cool, then<span class="pagenum" id="Page9">[9]</span>
fix it upon a thin plate of brass or silver, so that the middle of it
may be directly over the center of a very small hole made in this
plate, turning it till it is fixed by the before-mentioned thread
of glass. When the plate is properly fixed to your microscope,
and the object adjusted to the focal distance of the globule, you
will perceive the object distinctly and immensely magnified.
&#8220;By these means,&#8221; says Dr. Hooke, &#8220;I have been able to distinguish
the particles of bodies not only a million times smaller
than a visible point, but even to make those visible whereof a
million of millions would hardly make up the bulk of the smallest
visible grain of sand; so prodigiously do these exceeding small
globules enlarge our prospect into the more hidden recesses of
nature.&#8221;</p>

<div class="footnote">

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Mr. Butterfield, in making of the globules, used a lamp with
spirit of wine; but instead of a cotton wick, he used fine silver
wire, doubled up and down like a skain of thread.<a href="#Footnote10" id="FNanchor10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> He prepared
his glass by beating it to powder, and washing it very clean; he
then took a little of this glass upon the sharp point of a silver
needle, wetted with spittle, and held it in the flame, turning it
about till a glass ball was formed; then taking it from the flame,
he afterwards cleaned it with soft leather, and set it in a brass
cell.</p>

<p>No person has carried the use of these globules so far as Father
Di Torre, of Naples, nor been so dexterous in the execution of
them; and if others have not been able to follow him in the same
line, it may be fairly attributed to a want of that delicacy of
touch for adjusting the objects to their focus, and that acuteness
of vision which can only be acquired by long practice. Di Torre
has also described, more minutely than any other author, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page10">[10]</span>
mode of executing these globules, which, as it throws much light
upon the preceding description by Dr. Hooke, will not, it is presumed,
be unacceptable to the reader.</p>

<p>Three things are necessary for forming of these globules:
1. A lamp and bellows, such as are used by the glass-blowers.
2. A piece of perfect tripoli. 3. A variety of small glass rods.
When the flame of the lamp is blown in an horizontal direction,
it will be found to consist of two parts; from the base to about
two thirds of its length, it is of a white colour; beyond this, it
is transparent and colourless. It is this transparent part which
is to be used for melting the glass, because by this it will not be
in the least sullied; but it will be immediately soiled, if it touch
the white part of the flame. The part of the glass which is presented
to the flame, ought to be exceeding clean, and great care
should be taken that it be not touched by the fingers. If the
glass rod has contracted any spots, it must either be thrown
away, or the parts that are spotted must be cut off.</p>

<p>The piece of tripoli which is to be used in forming the globules,
should be flat on one side, and so large that it may be
handled conveniently, and protect the fingers from the flame. A
piece four or five inches long, and three or four inches thick, will
answer very well. The best tripoli for this purpose is of a white
colour, with a fine grain, heavy and compact, and which, after
it has been calcined, is of a red colour. This kind resists the fire
best, is not apt to break when calcined, and the melted glass does
not adhere to it. To calcine this tripoli, cover it well all round
with charcoal nearly red hot, leaving it thus till the charcoal is
quite cold; it may then be taken out. Let several hemispherical
cavities be made on the flat side of the tripoli; they should be of
different sizes, nicely polished, and neatly rounded at the edges,
in order to facilitate the entrance of the flame. The large globules<span class="pagenum" id="Page11">[11]</span>
are to be placed in the large cavities, and the minuter ones,
in the small cavities. The holes in the tripoli must never be
touched with the finger. If it be necessary to clean them, it
should be done with white paper; the larger globules may be
cleaned with wash leather. The glass rods should be of various
sizes, as of <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub>th, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>20</sub>th,
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>30</sub>th of an inch in diameter, as clean
and free from specks and bubbles as possible.</p>

<h3>TO MAKE SMALL GLASS MICROSCOPIC GLOBULES.</h3>

<p>Take two rods of glass, one in each hand, place their extremities
close to each other, and in the purest part of the flame; when
you perceive the ends to be fused, separate them from each other;
the heated glass following each rod, will be finer, in proportion
to the length it is drawn to, and the smallness of the rod; in this
manner you may procure threads of glass of any degree of fineness.
Direct the flame to the middle of the thread, and it will
be instantly divided into two parts. When one of the threads is
perfectly cool, place it at the extremity of the flame, by which it
will be rendered round; and, if the thread of glass be very fine,
an exceeding small globule will be formed. This thread may
now be broke off from the rod, and a new one may be again
drawn out as before, by the assistance of the other glass rod.</p>

<p>The small ball is now to be separated from the thread of glass;
this is easily effected by the sharp edge of a piece of flint. The
ball should be placed in a groove of paper, and another piece of
paper be held over it, to prevent the ball from flying about and
being lost. A quantity of globules ought to be prepared in this
manner; they are then to be cleaned, and afterwards placed in the
cavities of the tripoli, by means of a delicate pair of nippers.
The globules are now to be melted a second time, in order to
render them completely spherical; for this purpose, bring one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page12">[12]</span>
the cavities near the extremity of the flame, directing this towards
the tripoli, which must be first heated; the cavity is then
to be lowered, so that the flame may touch the glass, which,
when it is red hot, will assume a perfect globular form; it must
then be removed from the flame, and laid by; when cold, it should
be cleaned, by rubbing between two pieces of white paper. Let
it now be set in a brass cap, to try whether the figure be perfect.
If the object be not well defined, the globule must be thrown
away. Though, if it be large, it may be exposed two or three
times to the flame. When a large globule is forming, it should
be gently agitated by shaking the tripoli, which will prevent its
becoming flat on one side. By attending to these directions, the
greater part of the globules will be round and fit for use. In
damp weather, notwithstanding every precaution, it will often
happen, that out of forty globules, four or five only will be fit
for use.</p>

<p>Mr. Stephen Gray, of the Charter-House, having observed
some irregular particles within a glass globule, and finding that
they appeared distinct and prodigiously magnified when held close
to his eye, concluded, that if he placed a globule of water, in
which there were any particles more opake than the water, near
his eye, he should see those particles distinctly and highly magnified.
This idea, when realized, far exceeded his expectation.
His method was, to take on a pin a small portion of water which
he knew had in it some minute animalcul&aelig;; this he laid on the
end of a small piece of brass wire, till there was formed somewhat
more than an hemisphere of water; on applying it then to the
eye, he found the animalcul&aelig; most enormously magnified; for
those which were scarce discernible with his glass globules, with
this appeared as large as ordinary sized peas. They cannot be
seen in day-time, except the room be darkened, but are seen to
the greatest advantage by candle-light. Montucla observes, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page13">[13]</span>
when any objects are inclosed within this transparent globule,
the hinder part of it acts like a concave mirror, provided they be
situated between that surface and the focus; and that by these
means they are magnified three times and an half more than they
would be in the usual way. An extempore microscope may be
formed, by taking up a small drop of water on the point of a pin,
and placing it over a fine hole made in a piece of metal; but as
the refractive power of water is less than that of glass, these globules
do not magnify so much as those of the same size which are
made of glass: this was also contrived by Mr. Gray. The same
ingenious author invented another water microscope, consisting
of two drops of water, separated in part by a thin brass plate,
but touching near the center; which were thus rendered equivalent
to a double convex lens of unequal convexities.</p>

<p>Dr. Hooke describes a method of using the single microscope,
which seems to have a great analogy to the foregoing methods of
Mr. Gray. &#8220;If you are desirous,&#8221; says he, &#8220;of obtaining a microscope
with one single refraction, and consequently capable of
procuring the greatest clearness and brightness any one kind of
microscope is susceptible of; spread a little of the fluid you intend
to examine, on a glass plate, bring this under one of your microscopic
globules, then move it gently upwards, till the fluid touch
the globule, to which it will soon adhere, and that so firmly, as
to bear being moved a little backwards or forwards. By looking
through the globule, you will then have a perfect view of the
animalcul&aelig; in the drop.&#8221;<a href="#Footnote11" id="FNanchor11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Having laid before the reader the principal improvements that
have been suggested, or made in the single microscope, it remains
only to point out those instruments of this kind, which, from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page14">[14]</span>
mode in which they are fitted up, seem best adapted for general
use; the peculiar advantages of which, as well as the manner of
using them, will be described in the <a href="#Page64">third chapter</a> of this work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A compound microscope</span>, as it consists of two, three, or
more glasses, is more easily varied, and is susceptible of greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page15">[15]</span>
changes in its construction, than the single microscope. The
number of the lenses, of which it is formed, may be increased or
diminished, their respective positions may be varied, and the form
in which they are mounted be altered almost ad infinitum. But
among these varieties, some will be found more deserving of attention
than others; we shall here treat of these only.</p>

<p>The three first compound microscopes deserving of notice, are
those of Dr. Hooke, Eustachio Divinis, and Philip Bonnani. Dr.
Hooke gives an account of his in the preface to his Micrographia,
which has been already cited; it was about three inches in
diameter, seven long, and furnished with four draw-out tubes,
by which it might be lengthened as occasion required: it had
three glasses&mdash;a small object glass, a middle glass, and a deep
eye glass. Dr. Hooke used all the glasses when he wanted to
take in a considerable part of an object at once, as by the middle
glass a number of radiating pencils were conveyed to the eye,
which would otherwise have been lost: but when he wanted to
examine with accuracy the small parts of any substance, he took
out the middle glass, and only made use of the eye and object
lenses; for the fewer the refractions are, the clearer and more
bright the object appears.</p>

<p>An account of Eustachio Divinis&#8217;s microscope was read at the
Royal Society, in 1668.<a href="#Footnote12" id="FNanchor12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> It consisted of an object lens, a middle
glass, and two eye glasses, which were plano convex lenses,
and were placed so that they touched each other in the center of
their convex surfaces; by which means the glass takes in more of
an object, the field is larger, the extremities of it less curved, and
the magnifying power greater. The tube, in which the glasses
were inclosed, was as large as a man&#8217;s leg, and the eye glasses as<span class="pagenum" id="Page16">[16]</span>
broad as the palm of the hand. It had four several lengths;
when shut up, it was sixteen inches long, and magnified the diameter
of an object forty-one times; at the second length, ninety
times; at the third length, one hundred and eleven times; at the
fourth length, one hundred and forty-three times. It does not
appear that E. Divinis varied the object lenses.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Philip Bonnani published an account of his two microscopes in
1698;<a href="#Footnote13" id="FNanchor13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> both were compound; the first was similar to that which
Mr. Martin published as new, in his Micrographia Nova,<a href="#Footnote14" id="FNanchor14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> in
1742. His second was like the former, composed of three glasses,
one for the eye, a middle glass, and an object lens; they were
mounted in a cylindrical tube, which was placed in an horizontal
position; behind the stage was a small tube, with a convex lens
at each end; beyond this was a lamp; the whole capable of various
adjustments, and regulated by a pinion and rack; the small
tube was used to condense the light on the object, and spread it
uniformly over it according to its nature, and the magnifying
power that was used.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>If the reader attentively consider the construction of the foregoing
microscopes, and compare them with more modern ones,
he will be led to think with me, that the compound microscope
has received very little improvement since the time of Bonnani.
Taken separately, the foregoing constructions are equal to some
of the most famed modern microscopes. If their advantages be
combined, they are far superior to that of M. Dellebarre, notwithstanding
the pompous eulogium affixed thereto by Mess. De
L&#8217;Academie Royale des Sciences.<a href="#Footnote15" id="FNanchor15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>From this period, to the year 1736, the microscope appears not
to have received any considerable alteration, but the science itself
to have been at a stand. The improvements which were making
in the reflecting telescope, naturally led those who had considered
the subject, to expect a similar advantage would accrue to microscopes
on the same principles: accordingly we find two plans of
this kind; the first was that of Dr. Robert Barker. This instrument
is entirely the same as the reflecting telescope, excepting the
distance of the two speculums, which is lengthened, in order to
adapt it to those pencils of rays which enter the telescope diverging;
whereas, from very distant objects, they come in a direction
nearly parallel. But this was soon laid aside, not only as it was
more difficult to manage, but also because it was unfit for any but
very small or transparent objects: for the object being between
the speculum and the image, would, if it were large and opake,
prevent a due reflection of light on the object.</p>

<p>The second was contrived by Dr. Smith.<a href="#Footnote16" id="FNanchor16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> In this there were
two reflecting mirrors, one concave and the other convex; the
image was viewed by a lens. This microscope, though far from
being executed in the best manner, performed, says Dr. Smith,
very well, so that he did not doubt but that it would have excelled
others, if it had been properly finished.</p>

<p>As some years are more favourable to the fruits of the earth, so
also some periods are more favourable to particular sciences, being
rich in discovery, and cultivated with ardor. Thus, in the year
1738, Dr. Lieberk&uuml;hn&#8217;s invention of the solar microscope was
communicated to the public: the vast magnifying power which
was obtained by this instrument, the colossal grandeur with which
it exhibited the minima of nature, the pleasure which arose from<span class="pagenum" id="Page18">[18]</span>
being able to display the same object to a number of observers at
the same time, by affording a new source of rational amusement,
increased the number of microscopic observers, who were further
stimulated to the same pursuits by Mr. Trembley&#8217;s famous discovery
of the polype: the wonderful properties of this little animal,
together with the works of Mr. Trembley, Baker, and my father,
revived the reputation of this instrument.<a href="#Footnote17" id="FNanchor17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Every optician now exercised his talents in improving, as he
called it, the microscope; in other words, in varying its construction,
and rendering it different from that sold by his neighbour.
Their principal object seemed to be, only to subdivide the instrument,
and make it lie in as small a compass as possible; by which
means, they not only rendered it complex and troublesome in use,
but lost sight also of the extensive field, great light, and other
excellent properties of the more ancient instruments; and, in some
measure, shut themselves out from further improvements on the
microscope. Every mechanical instrument is susceptible of almost
infinite combinations and changes, which are attended with their
relative advantages and disadvantages: thus, what is gained in
power, is lost in time; &#8220;he that loves to be confined to a small
house, must lose the benefit of air and exercise.&#8221;</p>

<p>The microscope, nearly at the same period, gave rise to M. Buffon&#8217;s
famous system of organic molecules, and M. Needham&#8217;s
incomprehensible ideas concerning a vegetable force and the vitality
of matter. M. Buffon has dressed up his system with all
the charms of eloquence, presenting it to the mind in the most
agreeable and lively colours, exerting the depths of erudition in
the most interesting and seducing manner to establish his hypothesis,<span class="pagenum" id="Page19">[19]</span>
making us almost ready to adopt it against the dictates of
reason, and the evidence of facts. But whether this great man
was misled by the warmth of his imagination, his attachment to
a favourite system, or the use of imperfect instruments, it appears
but too evident, that he was not acquainted with the objects
whose nature he attempted to investigate; and it is probable,
that he never saw<a href="#Footnote18" id="FNanchor18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> those which he supposed he was describing,
continually confounding the animalcul&aelig; produced from the putrifying
decomposition of animal substances, with the spermatic
animalcul&aelig;, although they are two kinds of beings, differing in
form and nature; so that the beautiful fabric attempted to be
raised on his hypothesis, vanishes before the light of truth and
well conducted experiments.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>After this period, the mind, either satisfied with the discoveries
already made, which will be particularly described hereafter, or
tired by its own exertions, sought for repose in other pursuits; so
that for several years this instrument was again, in some measure,
laid aside. In 1770, Dr. Hill<a href="#Footnote19" id="FNanchor19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> published a treatise, in which he
endeavoured to explain the construction of timber by the microscope,
and shew the number, the nature, and office of its several
parts, their various arrangements and proportions in the different
kinds; and point out a way of judging, from the structure of
trees, the uses they will best serve in the affairs of life. So important
a subject soon revived the ardor for microscopic pursuits,
which seems to have been increasing ever since. About the same
time, my father contrived an instrument for cutting the transverse
sections of wood, in order that the texture thereof might be<span class="pagenum" id="Page20">[20]</span>
rendered more visible in the microscope, and consequently be
better understood; this instrument was afterwards improved by
Mr. Cumming. Another instrument for the same purpose, more
certain in its effects, and more easily managed, is represented in
Fig. 1. <a href="#Plate9">Plate IX</a>; and will be described in one of the following
chapters. Dr. Hill and Mr. Custance now endeavoured to bring
back the microscope nearer to the old standard, to increase the
field by the multiplication of the eye glasses, and to augment the
light on the object, by condensing lenses; and in this they happily
succeeded: Mr. Custance was unrivalled in his dexterity in
preparing, and accuracy in cutting thin transverse sections of
wood.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>In 1771, my father published a fourth edition of his Micrographia,
in which he described the principal inventions then in
use; particularly a contrivance of his own, for applying the solar
microscope to the camera obscura, and illuminating it at night by
a lamp, by which means a picture of microscopic objects might
be exhibited in winter evenings.</p>

<p>It appears<a href="#Footnote20" id="FNanchor20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
from the testimony of M. &AElig;pinus, that Dr. Lieberk&uuml;hn
had considerably improved the solar microscope, by
adapting it to view opake objects. This contrivance was by some
means lost. The knowledge, however, that such an effect had
been produced, led &AElig;pinus to attend to the subject himself, in
which he in some measure succeeded, and would, no doubt, have
brought it to perfection, if he had increased the size of his illuminating
mirror. Some further improvements were made on this
instrument by M. Ziehr; but the most perfect instrument of the
kind, is that of Mr. B. Martin, who published an account of it in<span class="pagenum" id="Page21">[21]</span>
the year 1774.<a href="#Footnote21" id="FNanchor21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The common solar microscope does not shew
the surface of any object, whereas the opake solar microscope not
only magnifies the object, but exhibits on a screen an expanded
picture of its surface, with all its colours, in a most beautiful
manner.</p>

<p>About the year 1774, I invented the improved lucernal microscope;
this instrument does not in the least fatigue the eye: it
shews all opake objects in a most beautiful manner; and transparent
objects may be examined by it in various ways, so that no
part of an object is left unexplored; and the outlines of all may
be taken with ease, even by those who are most unskilled in
drawing.</p>

<p>M. L. F. Dellebarre published an account of his microscope in
the year 1777. It does not appear from this, that it was superior
in any respect to those that were made in England, but was
inferior in others; for those published by my father in 1771
possessed all the advantages of Dellebarre&#8217;s in a higher degree,
except that of changing the eye glasses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page22">[22]</span></p>

<p>In 1784, M. &AElig;pinus published a description of what he termed
new-invented microscopes, in a letter to the Academy of Sciences
at Petersburgh;<a href="#Footnote22" id="FNanchor22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> they are nothing more than an application of
the achromatic perspective to microscopic purposes. Now it has
been long known to every one who is the least versed in optics,
that any telescope is easily converted into a microscope, by removing
the object glass to a greater distance from the eye glasses;
and that the distance of the image varies with the distance of the
object from the focus, and is magnified more as its distance from
the object is greater: the same telescope may, therefore be successively
turned into a microscope, with different magnifying
powers. Mr. Martin had also shewn, in his description and use
of a polydynamic microscope, how easily the small achromatic
perspective may be applied to this purpose. Botanists might find
some advantage in attending to this instrument; it would assist
them in discovering small plants at a distance, and thus often save
them from the thorns of the hedge, and the dirt of a ditch.</p>

<p>We cannot conclude this chapter better than with the following
observations on the microscope. We are indebted to it for
many discoveries in natural history; but let us not suppose that
the Creator intended to hide these objects from our observation.
It is true, this instrument discovers to us as it were a new creation,
new series of animals, new forests of vegetables; but he
who gave being to these, gave us an understanding capable of
inventing means to assist our organs in the discovery of their
hidden beauties. He gave us eyes adapted to enlarge our ideas,
and capable of comprehending a universe at one view, and consequently
incapable of discerning those minute beings, with
which he has peopled every atom of the universe. But then he
gave properties and qualities to matter of a particular kind, by
which it would procure us this advantage, and at the same time
elevated the understanding from one degree of knowledge to another,
till it was able to discover these assistances for our sight.</p>

<p>It is thus we should consider the discoveries made by those instruments,
which have received their birth from an exertion of
our faculties. It is to the same power, who created the objects
of our admiration, that we are ultimately to refer the means of
discovering them. Let no one, therefore, accuse us of prying
deeper into the wonders of nature, than was intended by the
great author of the universe. There is nothing we discover by
their assistance, which is not a fresh source of praise; and it does
not appear that our faculties can be better employed, than in
finding means to investigate the works of God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page24">[24]</span></p>

<p>From a partial consideration of these things, we are very apt to
criticise what we ought to admire; to look upon as useless what
perhaps we should own to be of infinite advantage to us, did we
see a little farther; to be peevish where we ought to give thanks;
and at the same time to ridicule those who employ their time and
thoughts in examining what we were, i. e. some of us most assuredly
were created and appointed to study. In short, we are
too apt to treat the Almighty worse than a rational man would
treat a good mechanic, whose works he would either thoroughly
examine, or be ashamed to find any fault with them. This is
the effect of a partial consideration of nature; but he who has
candor of mind, and leisure to look farther, will be inclined to
cry out:</p>

<h2><span class="chapno">CHAP. II.</span><br />
<span class="chapname">OF VISION; OF THE OPTICAL EFFECT OF MICROSCOPES, AND OF
THE MANNER OF ESTIMATING THEIR MAGNIFYING POWERS.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="startcapital">T</span>he progress that has been made in the science of optics, in
the last and present century, particularly by Sir Isaac Newton,
may with propriety be ranked among the greatest acquisitions of
human knowledge. And Mess. Delaval and Herschel have
shewn by their discoveries, that the boundaries of this science
may be considerably enlarged.</p>

<p>The rays of light, which minister to the sense of sight, are the
most wonderful and astonishing part of the inanimate creation;
of which we shall soon be convinced, if we consider their extreme
minuteness, their inconceivable velocity, the regular variety
of colours they exhibit, the invariable laws according to which
they are acted upon by other substances, in their reflections, inflections,
and refractions, without the least change of their original
properties; and the facility with which they pervade bodies
of the greatest density and closest texture, without resistance,
without crouding or disturbing each other. These, I believe, will
be deemed sufficient proofs of the wonderful nature of these rays;
without adding, that it is by a peculiar modification of them, that
we are indebted for the advantages obtained by the microscope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page27">[27]</span></p>

<p>The science of optics, which explains and treats of many of
the properties of those rays of light, is deduced from experiments,
on which all philosophers are agreed. It is impossible to give an
adequate idea of the nature of vision, without a knowledge of
these experiments, and the mathematical reasoning grounded
upon them; but as to do this would alone fill a large volume, I
shall only endeavour to render some of the more general principles
clear, that the reader, who is unacquainted with the science
of optics, may nevertheless be enabled to comprehend the nature
of vision by the microscope. Some of the most important of
these principles may be deduced from the following very interesting
experiment.</p>

<p>Darken a room, and let the light be admitted therein only by
a small hole; then, if the weather be fine, you will see on the
wall, which is facing the hole, a picture of all those exterior objects
which are opposite thereto, with all their colours, though
these will be but faintly seen. The image of the objects that are
stationary, as trees, houses, &amp;c. will appear fixed; while the
images of those that are in motion, will be seen to move. The
image of every object will appear inverted, because the rays cross
each other in passing through the small hole. If the sun shine
on the hole, we shall see a luminous ray proceed in a strait line,
and terminate on the wall. If the eye be placed in this ray, it
will be in a right line with the hole and the sun: it is the same
with every other object which is painted on the wall. The
images of the objects exhibited on the same plane, are smaller in
proportion as the objects are further from the hole.</p>

<p>Many and important are the inferences which may be deduced
from the foregoing experiment, among which are the following:</p>

<p>1. That light flows in a right line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page28">[28]</span></p>

<p>2. That a luminous point may be seen from all those places to
which a strait line can be drawn from the point, without meeting
with any obstacle; and consequently,</p>

<p>3. That a luminous point, by some unknown power, sends
forth rays of light in all directions, and is the center of a sphere
of light, which extends indefinitely on all sides; and if we conceive
some of these rays to be intercepted by a plane, then is the
luminous point the summit of a pyramid, whose body is formed
by the rays, and its base by the intercepting plane. The image
of the surface of an object, which is painted on the wall, is also
the base of a pyramid of light, the apex of which is the hole; the
rays which form this pyramid, by crossing at the hole, form
another, similar and opposite to this, of which the hole is also
the summit, and the surface of the object the base.</p>

<p>4. That an object is visible, because all its points are radiant
points.</p>

<p>5. That the particles of light are indefinitely small; for the
rays, which proceed from the points of all the objects opposite to
the hole, pass through it, though extremely small, without embarrassing
or confounding each other.</p>

<p>6. That every ray of light carries with it the image of the object
from which it was emitted.</p>

<p>The nature of vision in the eye may be imperfectly illustrated
by the experiment of the darkened room; the pupil of the eye
being considered as the hole through which the rays of light pass,
and cross each other, to paint on the retina, at the bottom of the
eye, the inverted images of all those objects which are exposed to
the sight, so that the diameters of the images of the same object<span class="pagenum" id="Page29">[29]</span>
are greater, in proportion to the angles formed at the pupil, by
the crossing rays which proceed from the extremities of the
object; that is, the diameter of the image is greater, in proportion
as the distance is less; or, in other words, the apparent magnitude
of an object is in some degree measured by the angle under
which it is seen, and this angle increases or diminishes, according
as the object is nearer to, or farther from the eye; and consequently,
the less the distance is between the eye and the object,
the larger the latter will appear.</p>

<p>From hence it follows, that the apparent diameter of an object
seen by the naked eye, may be magnified in any proportion we
please; for, as the apparent diameter is increased, in proportion
as the distance from the eye is lessenned, we have only to lessen
the distance of the object from the eye, in order to increase the
apparent diameter thereof.<a href="#Footnote24" id="FNanchor24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Thus, suppose there is an object,
A B, <a href="#Plate1">Plate I.</a> Fig. 1, which to an eye at E subtends or appears
under the angle A E B, we may magnify the apparent diameter
in what proportion we please, by bringing our eye nearer to it.
If, for instance, we would magnify it in the proportion of F G
to A B; that is, if we would see the object under an angle as
large as F E G, or would make it appear the same length that an
object as long as F G would appear, it may be done by coming
nearer to the object. For the apparent diameter is as the distance
inversely; therefore, if C D is as much less than C E, as F G
is greater than A B, by bringing the eye nearer to the object in
the proportion of C D to E D, the apparent diameter will be
magnified in the proportion of F G to A B; so that the object
A B, to the eye at D, will appear as long as an object F G would
appear to the eye at E. In the same manner we might shew,
that the apparent diameter of an object, when seen by the naked<span class="pagenum" id="Page30">[30]</span>
eye, may be infinite. For since the apparent diameter is reciprocally
as the distance of the eye, when the distance of the eye is
nothing or when the eye is close to the object at C, the apparent
diameter will be the reciprocal of nothing, or infinite.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>There is, however, one great inconvenience in thus magnifying
an object, without the help of glasses, by placing the eye
nearer to it. The inconvenience is, that we cannot see an object
distinctly, unless the eye is about five or six inches from it;
therefore, if we bring it nearer to our eye than five or six inches,
however it may be magnified, it will be seen confusedly. Upon
this account, the greatest apparent magnitude of an object that
we are used to, is the apparent magnitude when the eye is about
five or six inches from it: and we never place an object much
within that distance; because, though it might be magnified by
these means, yet the confusion would prevent our deriving any
advantage from seeing it so large. The size of an object seems
extraordinary, when viewed through a convex lens; not because
it is impossible to make it appear of the same size to the naked
eye, but because at the distance from the eye which would be
necessary for this purpose, it would appear exceedingly confused;
for which reason, we never bring our eye so near to it, and consequently,
as we have not been accustomed to see the object of
this size, it appears an extraordinary one.</p>

<p>On account of the extreme minuteness of the atoms of light, it
is clear, a single ray, or even a small number of rays, cannot
make a sensible impression on the organ of sight, whose fibres
are very gross, when compared to these atoms; it is necessary,
therefore, that a great number should proceed from the surface of
an object, to render it visible. But as the rays of light, which
proceed from an object, are continually diverging, different methods
have been contrived, either of uniting them in a given<span class="pagenum" id="Page31">[31]</span>
point, or of separating them at pleasure: the manner of doing
this is the subject of dioptrics and catoptrics.</p>

<p>By the help of glasses, we unite in the same sensible point a
great number or rays, proceeding from one point of an object;
and as each ray carries with it the image of the point from
whence it proceeded, all the rays united must form an image of
the object from whence they were emitted. This image is
brighter, in proportion as there are more rays united; and more
distinct, in proportion as the order, in which they proceeded, is
better preserved in their union. This may be rendered evident;
for, if a white and polished plane be placed where the union is
formed, we shall see the image of the object painted in all its
colours on this plane; which image will be brighter, if all adventitious
light be excluded from the plane on which it is received.</p>

<p>The point of union of the rays of light, formed by means of a
glass lens, &amp;c. is called the <span class="smcapall">FOCUS</span>.</p>

<p>Now, as each ray carries with it the image of the object from
whence it proceeded, it follows, that if those rays, after intersecting
each other, and having formed an image at their intersection,
are again united by a refraction or reflection, they will
form a new image, and that repeatedly, as long as their order is
not confounded or disturbed.</p>

<p>It follows also, that when the progress of the luminous ray is
under consideration, we may look on the image as the object, and
the object as the image; and consider the second image as if it had
been produced by the first as an object, and so on.</p>

<p>In order to gain a clear idea of the wonderful effects produced
by glasses, we must proceed to say something of the principles
of refraction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page32">[32]</span></p>

<p>Any body, which is so constituted as to yield a passage to the
rays of light, is called a <span class="smcapall">MEDIUM</span>. Air, water, glass, &amp;c. are
mediums of light. If any medium afford an easy passage to the
rays of light, it is called a <span class="smcapall">RARE MEDIUM</span>; but if it do not afford
an easy passage to these rays, it is called a <span class="smcapall">DENSE MEDIUM</span>.</p>

<p>Let Z, Fig. 2. <a href="#Plate1">Plate I.</a> be a rare medium, and Y a dense one;
and let them be separated by the plane surface G H. Let I K be
a perpendicular to it, and cutting it in C.</p>

<p>With the center C, and any distance, let a circle be described.
Then let A C be a ray of light, falling upon the dense medium.
This ray, if nothing prevented, would go forward to L; but because
the medium Y is supposed to be denser than Z, it will be
bent downward toward the perpendicular I K, and describe the
line C B.</p>

<p>The ray A C is called the <span class="smcapall">INCIDENT RAY</span>; and the ray C B, the
<span class="smcapall">REFRACTED RAY</span>.</p>

<p>The angle A C I is called the <span class="smcapall">ANGLE OF INCIDENCE</span>, and the
angle B C K is called the <span class="smcapall">ANGLE OF REFRACTION</span>.</p>

<p>If from the point A upon the right line C I, there be let fall
the perpendicular A D, that line is called the sine of the angle of
incidence.</p>

<p>In the same manner, if from the point B, upon the right line
I K, there be let fall the perpendicular B E, that line will be the
sine of the angle of refraction.</p>

<p>The sines of the angles are the measures of the refractions, and
this measure is constant; that is, whatever is the sine of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page33">[33]</span>
angle of incidence, it will be in a constant proportion to the sine
of the angle of refraction, when the mediums continue the same.
A general idea of refraction may be formed from the following
experiments.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Experiment 1.</span> Let A B C D,
Fig. 3. <a href="#Plate1">Plate I.</a> represent a vessel
so placed, with respect to the candle E, that the shadow of
the side A C may fall at D. Suppose the vessel to be now filled
with water, and the shadow will withdraw to d; the ray of light,
instead of proceeding to D, being refracted or bent to d. And
there is no doubt but that an eye, placed at d, would see the
candle at e, in the direction of the refracted ray d A. This is
also confirmed by the following pleasing experiment.</p>

<p>2. Lay a shilling, or any piece of money, at the bottom of a
bason; then withdraw from the bason, till you lose sight of the
shilling; fill the bason nearly with water, and the shilling will be
seen very plainly, though you are at the same distance from it.</p>

<p>3. Place a stick over a bason which is filled with water; then
reflect the sun&#8217;s rays, so that they may fall perpendicularly on
the surface of the water; the shadow of the stick will fall on the
same place, whether the vessel be empty or full.</p>

<p>What has been said of water, may be applied to any transparent
medium, only the power of refraction is greater in some
than in others. It is from this wonderful property, that we
derive all the curious effects of glass, which make it the subject
of optics. It is to this we owe the powers of the microscope
and the telescope.</p>

<p>To produce these effects, pieces of glass are formed into given
figures, which, when so formed, are called lenses. The six following<span class="pagenum" id="Page34">[34]</span>
figures are those which are most in use for optical purposes.</p>

<p>1. A <span class="smcapall">PLANE GLASS</span>, one that is flat on each side, and of an
equal thickness throughout. F, Fig. 13. <a href="#Plate1">Plate I.</a></p>

<p>2. A <span class="smcapall">DOUBLE CONVEX GLASS</span>, one that is more elevated towards
the middle than the edge. B, Fig. 13. <a href="#Plate1">Plate I.</a></p>

<p>3. A <span class="smcapall">DOUBLE CONCAVE</span> is hollow on both sides, or thinner in
the middle than at the edges. D, Fig. 13. <a href="#Plate1">Plate I.</a></p>

<p>4. A <span class="smcapall">PLANO CONVEX</span>, flat on one side, and convex on the
other. A, Fig. 13. <a href="#Plate1">Plate I.</a></p>

<p>5. A <span class="smcapall">PLANO CONCAVE</span>, flat on one side, and concave on the
other. C, Fig. 13. <a href="#Plate1">Plate I.</a></p>

<p>6. A <span class="smcapall">MENISCUS</span>, convex on one side, concave on the other.
E, Fig. 13. <a href="#Plate1">Plate I.</a></p>

<p>It has been already observed, that light proceeds invariably
from a luminous body, in strait lines, without the least deviation;
but if it happen to pass from one medium to another, it
always leaves the direction it had before, and assumes a new one.
After having taken this new direction, it proceeds in a strait line,
till it meets with a different medium, which again turns it out of
its course.</p>

<p>A ray of light passing obliquely through a plane glass, will go
out in the same direction it entered, though not precisely in the
same line. The ray C D, Fig. 4. <a href="#Plate1">Plate I.</a> falling obliquely upon
the surface of the plane glass A B, will be refracted towards the<span class="pagenum" id="Page35">[35]</span>
glass in the direction D E; but when it comes to E, it will be as
much refracted the contrary way. If the ray of light had fallen
perpendicularly on the surface of the plane glass, it would have
passed through it in a strait line, and not have been refracted
at all.</p>

<p>If parallel rays of light, as a b c d e f g,
Fig. 6. <a href="#Plate1">Plate I.</a> fall
directly upon a convex lens A B, they will be so bent, as to
unite in a point C behind it. For the ray d D which falls perpendicularly
upon the middle of the glass, will go through it
without suffering any refraction: but those which go through the
sides of the lens, falling obliquely on its surface, will be so bent,
as to meet the central ray at C. The further the ray a is from
the axis of the lens, the more obliquely it will fall upon it. The
rays a b c d e f g will be so refracted, as to meet or be collected
in the point C, called the principal focus, whose distance, in a
double convex lens, is equal to the radius or semi-diameter of the
sphere of the convexity of the lens. All the rays cross the middle
ray at C, and then diverge from it to the contrary side, in the
same manner as they were before converged.</p>

<p>If another lens, of the same convexity, as A B, Fig. 6. <a href="#Plate6">Plate I.</a>
be placed in the rays, and at the same distance from the focus,
it will refract them, so that after going out of it, they will all be
parallel again, and go on in the same manner as they came to the
first glass A B, but on the contrary sides of the middle ray.</p>

<p>The rays diverge from any radiant point, as from a principal
focus: therefore, if a candle be placed at C, in the focus of the
convex lens A B, Fig. 6. <a href="#Plate6">Plate I.</a> the rays diverging from it will be
so refracted by the lens, that after going out of it, they will become
parallel. If the candle be placed nearer the lens than its<span class="pagenum" id="Page36">[36]</span>
focal distance, the rays will diverge more or less, as the candle is
more or less distant from the focus.</p>

<p>If any object, A B, Fig. 7. <a href="#Plate1">Plate I.</a> be placed beyond the focus
of the convex lens E F, some of the rays which flow from every
point of the object, on the side next the glass, will fall upon it,
and after passing through it, they will be converged into as many
points on the opposite side of the glass; for the rays a b, which
flow from the point A, will converge into <i>a b</i>, and meet at C.
The rays c d, flowing from the point G, will be converged into
<i>c d</i>, and meet at g; and the rays which flow from B, will meet
each other again at D; and so of the rays which flow from any
of the intermediate points: for there will be as many focal points
formed, as there are radiant points in the object, and consequently
they will depict on a sheet of paper, or any other light-coloured
body, placed at D g C, an inverted image of the object.
If the object be brought nearer the lens, the picture will be
formed further off. If it be placed at the principal focus, the
rays will go out parallel, and consequently form no picture behind
the glass.</p>

<p>To render this still plainer, let us divest what has been said
of the A&#8217;s and B&#8217;s, and of the references to figures. When objects
are viewed through a flat or plane glass, the rays of light
in passing through it, from the object to the eye, proceed in a
strait direction and parallel to each other, and consequently the
object appeared at the same distance as to the naked eye, neither
enlarged or diminished. But if the glass be of a convex form,
the rays of light change their direction in passing through the
glass, and incline from the circumference towards the center of
convexity, in an angle proportional to the convexity, and meet at
a point at a less or greater distance from the glass, as it is more
or less convex. The point where the rays thus meet is called the<span class="pagenum" id="Page37">[37]</span>
focus; when, therefore, the convexity is small, the focus is at a
great distance, but when it is considerable, the focus is near; the
magnifying power is in proportion to the change made in the
rays, or the degree of convexity, by which we are enabled to see
an object nearer than we otherwise could; and the nearer it is
brought to the eye, the larger will be the angle under which it
appears, and consequently the more it will be magnified.</p>

<p>The human eye is so constituted, that it can only have distinct
vision, when the rays which fall on it are parallel, or nearly so;
because the retina, on which the image is painted, is placed in
the focus of the crystalline humor, which performs the office of
a lens in collecting rays, and forming the image in the bottom of
the eye.</p>

<p>As an object becomes perceptible to us, by means of the image
thereof which is formed on the retina, it will, therefore, be seen
in that direction, in which the rays enter the eye to form the
image, and will always be found in the line, in which the axis of
a pencil of rays flowing from it enters the eye. We from hence
acquire a habit of judging the object to be situated in that line.
Note; as the mind is unacquainted with the refraction the rays
suffer before they enter the eye, it judges them to be in the line
produced back, in which the axis of a pencil of rays flowing from it
is situated, and not in that in which it was before the refraction.</p>

<p>If the rays, therefore, that proceed from an object, are refracted
and reflected several times before they enter the eye, and these
refractions or reflections change considerably the original direction
of the rays which proceed from the object, it is clear, that it
will not be seen in that line, which would come strait from it to
the eye; but it will be seen in the direction of those rays which
enter the eye, and form the image thereof on it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page38">[38]</span></p>

<p>We perceive the presence and figure of objects, by the impression
each respective image makes on the retina; the mind, in
consequence of these impressions, forms conclusions concerning
the size, position, and motion of the object. It must however be
observed, that these conclusions are often rectified or changed by
the mind, in consequence of the effects of more habitual impressions.
For example, there is a certain distance, at which, in the
general business of life, we are accustomed to see objects: now,
though the measure of the image of these objects changes considerably
when they move from, or approach nearer to us, yet we
do not perceive that their size is much altered; but beyond this
distance, we find the objects appear to be diminished, or increased,
in proportion as they are more or less distant from us.</p>

<p>For instance, if I place my eye successively at two, at four,
and at six feet from the same person, the dimensions of the
image on the retina will be nearly in the proportion of 1, of <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>, of <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>3</sub>,
and consequently they should appear to be diminished in the
same proportion; but we do not perceive this diminution, because
the mind has rectified the impression received on the retina. To
prove this, we need only consider, that if we see a person at 120
feet distance, he will not appear so strikingly small, as if the
same person should be viewed from the top of a tower, or other
building 120 feet high, a situation to which we had not been
accustomed.</p>

<p>From hence, also, it is clear, that when we place a glass between
the object and the eye, which from its figure changes the
direction of the rays of light from the object, this object ought
not to be judged as if it were placed at the ordinary reach of the
sight, in which case we judge of its size more by habit than by
the dimensions of the images formed on the retina; but it must
be estimated by the size of the image in the eye, or by the angle<span class="pagenum" id="Page39">[39]</span>
formed at the eye, by the two rays which come from the extremity
of the object.</p>

<p>If the image of an object, formed after refraction, be greater or
less than the angle formed at the eye, by the rays proceeding
from the extremities of the object itself, the object will appear
also proportionably enlarged or diminished; so that if the eye
approach to or remove from the last image, the object will appear
to increase or diminish, though the eye should in reality remove
from it in one case, or approach toward it in the other; because
the image takes place of the object, and is considered instead of it.</p>

<p>The apparent distance of an object from the eye, is not measured
by the real distance from the last image; for, as the apparent
distance is estimated principally by the ideas we have of their
size, it follows, that when we see objects, whose images are increased
or diminished by refraction, we naturally judge them to
be nearer or further from the eye, in proportion to the size
thereof, when compared to that with which we are acquainted.
The apparent distance of an object is considerably affected by
the brightness, distinctness, and magnitude thereof. Now as
these circumstances are, in a certain degree, altered by the refraction
of the rays, in their passing through different mediums, they
will also, in some measure, affect the estimation of the apparent
distance.</p>

<p>In the theory of vision it is necessary to be cautious not to
confound the organs of vision with the being that perceives, or
with the perspective faculty. The eye is not that which sees, it
is only the organ by which we see. A man cannot see the satellites
of Jupiter but by a telescope. Does he conclude from this,
that it is the telescope that sees those stars? By no means; such
a conclusion would be absurd. It is no less absurd to conclude,<span class="pagenum" id="Page40">[40]</span>
that it is the eye that sees. The telescope is an artificial organ
of sight, but it sees not. The eye is a natural organ of sight, by
which we see; but the natural organ sees as little as the artificial.</p>

<p>The eye is a machine, most admirably contrived for refracting
the rays of light, and forming a distinct picture of objects upon
the retina; but it sees neither the object nor the picture. It can
form the picture after it is taken out of the head, but no vision
ensues. Even when it is in its proper place, and perfectly
sound, it is well known, that an obstruction in the optic nerve
takes away vision, though the eye has performed all that
belongs to it.<a href="#Footnote25" id="FNanchor25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<h3>OF THE SINGLE MICROSCOPE.</h3>

<p>The single microscope renders minute objects visible, by means
of a small glass globule, or convex lens, of a short focus. Let
E Y, Fig. 11. <a href="#Plate1">Plate I.</a> represent the eye; and O B a small object,
situated very near to it; consequently, the angle of its apparent
magnitude very large. Let the convex lens R S be interposed
between the eye and the object, so that the distance between it
and the object may be equal to the focal length; and the rays
which diverge from the object, and pass through the lens, will
afterwards proceed, and consequently enter the eye parallel:
after which, they will be converged, and form an inverted picture
on the retina, and the object will be clearly seen; though,
if removed to the distance of six inches, its smallness would render
it invisible.</p>

<p>When the lens is not held close to the eye, the object is somewhat
more magnified; because the pencils, which pass at a distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page41">[41]</span>
from the center of the lens, are refracted inward toward
the axis, and consequently seem to come from points more remote
from the center of the object, as may be seen in Fig. 12.
<a href="#Plate1">Plate I.</a> where the pencils which proceed from O and B are refracted
inwards, and seem to come from the point i and m.</p>

<p>Fig. 8. <a href="#Plate1">Plate I.</a> may, perhaps give the reader a still clearer view,
why a convex lens increases the angle of vision. Without a
lens, as F G, the eye at A would see the dart B C under the angle
b A c; but the rays B F and C G from the extremities of the dart
in passing through the lens, are refracted to the eye in the directions
f A and g A, which causes the dart to be seen under the
much larger angle D A E (the same as the angle f A g.) And
therefore the dart B C will appear so much magnified, as to extend
in length from D to E.</p>

<p>The object, when thus seen distinctly, by means of a small
lens, appears to be magnified nearly in the proportion which the
focal distance of the glass bears to the distance of the objects,
when viewed by the naked eye.</p>

<p>To explain this further, place the eye close to the glass, that as
much of the object may be seen at one view as is possible; then
remove the object to and fro, till it appear perfectly distinct, and
well defined; now remove the lens, and substitute in its place a
thin plate, with a very small hole in it, and the object will appear
as distinct, and as much magnified, as with the lens, though not
quite so bright; and it appears as much more magnified in this
case, than it does when viewed with the naked eye, as the distance
of the object from the hole, or lens, is less than the distance at
which it may be seen distinctly with the naked eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page42">[42]</span></p>

<p>From hence we see, that the whole effect of the lens is to
render the object distinct, which it does by assisting the eye to
increase the refraction of the rays in each pencil; and that the
apparent magnitude is entirely owing to the object being seen so
much nearer the eye than it could be viewed without it.</p>

<p>Single microscopes magnify the diameter of the object,<a href="#Footnote26" id="FNanchor26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> as we
have already shewn, in the proportion of the focal distance (to
the limits of distinct vision with the naked eye) to eight inches.
For example, if the semi-diameter of a lens, equally convex on
both sides, be half an inch, which is also equal to its focal distance,
we shall have as <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> is to 8, so is 1 to 16; that is, the diameter of
the object in the proportion of sixteen to one. 2. As the distance
of eight inches is always the same, it follows, that by how
much the focal distance is smaller, there will be a greater difference
between it and the eight inches; and consequently, the
diameter of the object will be so much the more magnified, in
proportion as the lenses are segments of smaller spheres. 3. If
the object be placed in the focus of a glass globule or sphere, and
the eye be behind it in the focus, the object will be seen distinct
in an erect situation, and magnified as to its diameter, in the
proportion of <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> of the diameter of the globule to eight inches;
thus suppose the diameter of the sphere to be <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub> of an inch, then
<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> of this will be equal to <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>40</sub>; consequently, the real diameter of
the object to the apparent one, as <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>40</sub> to 8, or as 3 to 320, or as
1 to 106 nearly.</p>

<h3>OF THE DOUBLE OR COMPOUND MICROSCOPE.</h3>

<p>In the compound microscope, the image is viewed instead of
the object, which image is magnified by a single lens, as the object
is in a single microscope. It consists of an object lens N L,<span class="pagenum" id="Page43">[43]</span>
Fig. 5. <a href="#Plate1">Plate I.</a> and an eye glass F G. The object B O is placed a
little further from the lens than its principal focal distance, so
that the pencils of rays proceeding from the different points of
the object through the lens, may converge to their respective foci,
and form an inverted image of the object at Q P; which image is
viewed by the eye through the eye glass F G, which is so placed,
that the image may be in its focus on one side, and the eye at the
same distance on the other. The rays of each pencil will be
parallel, after passing out of the glass, till they reach the eye at E,
where they will begin to converge by the refractive powers of
the humours; and after having crossed each other in the pupil,
and passed through the crystalline and vitreous humours, they
will be collected in points on the retina, and form a large inverted
image thereon.</p>

<p>It will be easy, from what has been already explained, to understand
the reason of the magnifying power of a compound
microscope. The object is magnified upon two accounts; first,
because if we viewed the image with the naked eye, it would
appear as much larger than the object, as the image is really larger
than it, or as the distance f R is greater than the distance f b;
and secondly, because this picture is again magnified by the eye
glass, upon the principle explained in the foregoing article on
vision, by single microscopes.</p>

<p>But it is to be noted, that the image formed in the focus of a
lens, as is the case in the compound microscope, differs from the
real object in a very essential particular; that is to say, the light
being emitted from the object in every direction, renders it visible
to an eye placed in any position; but the points of the image
formed by a lens, emitting no more than a small conical body of
rays, which arrives from the glass, can be visible only when the
eye is situate within its confine. Thus, the pencil, which emanates<span class="pagenum" id="Page44">[44]</span>
from o in the object, and is converged by the lens to D,
proceeds afterwards diverging towards H, and, therefore, never
arrives at the lens F G, nor enters the eye at E. But the pencils
which proceed from the points o and b, will be received on the
lens F G, and by it carried parallel to the eye; consequently, the
correspondent points of the image Q P will be visible; and those
which are situate farther out towards H and I, will not be seen.
This quantity of the image Q P, or visible area, is called the
field of view.</p>

<p>Hence it appears, that if the image be large, a very small part
of it will be visible; because the pencils of rays will for the most
part fall without the eye glass F G. And it is likewise plain, that
a remedy which would cause the pencils, which proceed from
the extremes B and O of the object, to arrive at the eye, will
render a greater part of it visible: or, in other words, enlarge the
field of view. This is effected by the interposition of a broad
lens D E, Fig. 5, of a proper curvature, at a small distance from
the focal image. For, by those means, the pencil D N, which
would otherwise have proceeded towards H, is refracted to the
eye, as delineated in the figure, and the mind conceives from
thence the existence of a radiant point at Q, from which the rays
last proceeded. In like manner, and by a parity of reason, the
other extreme of the image is seen at P, and the intermediate
points are also rendered visible. On these considerations it is,
that compound microscopes are usually made to consist of an
object lens N L, by which the image is formed, enlarged, and
inverted; an amplifying lens D E, by which the field of view is
enlarged, and an eye glass or lens, by which the eye is allowed to
approach very near, and consequently to view the image under
a very great angle of apparent magnitude. It is now customary
to combine two or more lenses together at the eye glass, in the
manner of Eustachio Divinis and M. Joblot; by which means<span class="pagenum" id="Page45">[45]</span>
the aberration of light from the figure is in some measure corrected,
and the apparent field increased.</p>

<h3>OF THE SOLAR MICROSCOPE.</h3>

<p>In this instrument, the image of the object is refracted upon a
screen in a darkened room. It may be considered under two
distinct heads: 1st, the mirror and lens, which are intended to
reflect and transmit the light of the sun upon the object; and
2dly, that part which constitutes the microscope, or which produces
the magnified image of the object, Fig. 10. <a href="#Plate1">Plate I.</a> Let N O
represent the side of a darkened chamber, G H a small convex
lens, fixed opposite to a perforation in the side N O, A B a plane
mirror or looking glass, placed without the room to reflect the
solar rays on the lens C D, by which they are converged and
concentrated on the object fixed at E F.</p>

<p>2. The object being thus illuminated, the ray which proceeds
from E will be converged by the lens G H to a focus K, on the
screen L M; and the ray which comes from F will be converged
to I, and the intermediate points will be delineated between I and
K; thus forming a picture, which will be as much larger than
the object, in proportion as the distance of the screen exceeds that
of the image from the object; a small object, such as a mite, &amp;c.
may be thus magnified to eight or ten feet in diameter.</p>

<p>From what has been said, it appears plainly, the advantages we
gain by microscopes are derived, first, from their magnifying
power, by which the eye is enabled to view more distinctly the
parts of minute objects: secondly, that by their assistance, more
light is thrown into the pupil of the eye, than is done without
them. The advantages procured by the magnifying power,
would be exceedingly circumscribed, if they were not accompanied<span class="pagenum" id="Page46">[46]</span>
by the latter: for if the same quantity of light be diffused
over a much larger surface, its force is proportionably diminished;
and therefore the object, though magnified, will be dark and
obscure. Thus, suppose the diameter of the object to be enlarged
ten times, and consequently the surface one-hundred times, yet,
if the focal distance of the glass were eight inches, provided this
were possible, and its diameter only about the size of the pupil of
the eye, the object would appear one-hundred times more obscure
when viewed through the glass, than when it was seen by
the naked eye; and this even on the supposition that the glass
transmitted all the light which fell upon it, which no glass can
do. But if the glass were only four inches focal distance, and its
diameter remained as before, the inconvenience would be vastly
diminished, because the glass could be placed twice as near the
object as before, and would consequently receive four times as
many rays as in the former case, and we should, therefore, see it
much brighter than before. By going on thus, diminishing the
focal distance of the glass, and keeping its diameter as large as
possible, we shall perceive the object proportionably magnified,
and yet remain bright and distinct. Though this is the case in
theory, yet there is a limit in optical instruments, which is soon
arrived at, but which cannot be passed. This arises from the
following circumstances.<a href="#Footnote27" id="FNanchor27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote27"><a href="#FNanchor27" class="label">[27]</a> Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica, last edition, vol. xiii, p. 357.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>1. The quantity of light lost in passing through the glass.</p>

<p>2. The diminution in the diameter of the glass or lens itself,
by which it receives only a small quantity of rays.</p>

<p>3. The extreme shortness of the focal distance of great magnifiers,
whereby the free access of the light to the object we wish<span class="pagenum" id="Page47">[47]</span>
to view is impeded, and consequently the reflection of the light
from it is weakened.</p>

<p>4. The aberration of the rays, occasioned by their different
refrangibility.</p>

<p>To make this more clear, let us suppose a lens made of such
dull kind of glass, that it transmits only one half the light that
falls upon it. It is evident, that supposing this lens to be of four
inches focus, and to magnify the diameter of the object twice,
and its own breadth equal to that of the pupil of the eye, the
object will be four times magnified in surface, but only half as
bright as if it was seen by the naked eye at the usual distance;
for the light which falls upon the eye from the object at eight
inches distance, and likewise the surface of the object in its natural
size, being both represented by 1, the surface of the magnified
object will be 4, and the light which makes it visible only 2;
because, though the glass receives four times as much light as the
naked eye does at the usual distance of distinct vision, yet one
half is lost in passing through the glass. The inconvenience, in
this respect, can only be removed so far as it is possible to increase
the transparency of the glass, that it may transmit nearly
all the rays which fall upon it; and how far this can be done,
has not been yet ascertained.</p>

<p>The second obstacle to the perfection of microscopic glasses, is
the small size of great magnifiers; by which means, notwithstanding
their near approach to the object, they receive a smaller quantity
of light than might be expected. Thus, suppose a glass of
only one-tenth of an inch focal distance, such a glass would increase
the visible diameter eighty times, and the surface 6400
times. If the breadth of the glass could at the same time be preserved
as great as the pupil of the eye, which we shall suppose<span class="pagenum" id="Page48">[48]</span>
one-tenth of an inch, the object would appear magnified 6400
times, and every part would be as bright as it appears to the
naked eye. But if we suppose the lens to be only <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>20</sub> of an inch
diameter, it will then only receive one-fourth of the light which
would otherwise have fallen upon it; therefore, instead of communicating
to the magnified object a quantity of light equal to
6400, it would communicate an illumination suited only to 1600,
and the magnified object would appear four times as dim as it does
to the naked eye. This inconvenience can, however, in a great
degree be removed, by throwing a much larger quantity of light
on the object. Various methods of effecting this purpose will be
pointed out in the course of this work.</p>

<p>The third obstacle arises from the shortness of the focal distance
in large magnifiers; this inconvenience can, like the former,
be remedied in some degree, by artificial means of accumulating
light; but still the eye is strained, as it must be brought nearer
the glass than it can well bear, which in some measure supersedes
the use of very deep lenses, or such as are capable of magnifying
beyond a certain degree.</p>

<p>The fourth obstacle arises from the different refrangibility of
the rays of light, which frequently causes such deviations from
truth in the appearance of things, that many have imagined
themselves to have made surprising discoveries, and have communicated
them as such to the world; when, in fact, they have
been only so many optical deceptions, owing to the unequal refraction
of the rays. In telescopes, this error has been happily
corrected by the late Mr. Dollond&#8217;s valuable discovery of achromatic
glasses; but how far this invention is applicable to the
improvement of microscopes, has not yet been ascertained; and,
indeed, from some few trials made, there is reason for supposing
they cannot be successfully applied to microscopes with high<span class="pagenum" id="Page49">[49]</span>
powers; so that this improvement is yet a desideratum in the
construction of microscopes, and they may be considered as being
yet far from their ultimate degree of perfection.<a href="#Footnote28" id="FNanchor28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<h3>OF THE MAGNIFYING POWERS OF THE MICROSCOPE.</h3>

<p>We have already treated of the apparent magnitude of objects,
and shewn that they are measured by the angles under which they
are seen, and that this angle is greater or smaller according as the
object is nearer to, or further from, the eye; and, consequently,
the less the distance at which it can be viewed, the larger it will
appear: but from the limits of natural vision, the naked eye cannot
distinguish an object that is very near to it; yet, when assisted
by a convex lens, distinct vision is obtained, however short
the focus of the lens, and, consequently, how near soever the
object is to the eye; and the shorter the focus of the lens is, the
greater will be the magnifying power thereof. From these considerations,
it will not be difficult to estimate the magnifying
power of any lens used as a single microscope; for this will be
in the same proportion that the limits of natural sight bear to the
focus of the lens. If, for instance, the convex lens is of one
inch focus, and the natural sight of eight inches, an object seen
through that lens will have its diameter apparently increased
eight times; but, as the object is increased in every direction,
we must square this apparent diameter, to know how much the
object is really magnified; and thus multiplying 8 by 8, we find
the superficies is magnified 64 times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page50">[50]</span></p>

<p>From these principles, the following general rule for ascertaining
the magnifying power of single lenses, is deduced. Place a
small thin transparent object on the stage of the microscope,
adjust the lens till the object appears perfectly distinct, then
measure the distance accurately between the lens and the object,
reduce the measure thus found to the hundredths of an inch, and
calculate how many times this measure is contained in eight
inches, first reducing the eight inches into hundredths, which
will give you the number of times the diameter of the object is
magnified; which number multiplied into itself, or squared, gives
the apparent superficial magnitude of the object.</p>

<p>As only one side of an object can be viewed at a time, it is
sufficient, in general, to know how much the surface thereof is
magnified: but when it is necessary to know how many minute
objects are contained in a larger, as for instance, how many given
animalcul&aelig; are contained in the bulk of a grain of sand, then we
must cube the first number, by which means we shall obtain the
solidity or magnified bulk.</p>

<p>The foregoing rule has been also applied to estimate the magnifying
power of the compound microscope. To this application,
Mr. Magny, in the &#8220;Journal d&#8217;Economie pour le mois
d&#8217;Aout 1753,&#8221; has made several objections: one or two of these
I shall just mention; the first is the difficulty of ascertaining with
accuracy the precise focus of a small lens; the second is the want
of a fixed or known measure, with which to compare the focus
when ascertained. These considerations, though apparently trifling,
will be found of importance in the calculations which are
relative to deep magnifiers. To this it may be further added,
that the same standard or fixed measure cannot be assumed for a
short-sighted, that is used for a well-constituted eye. To obviate
these difficulties, and some errors in the methods which were recommended<span class="pagenum" id="Page51">[51]</span>
by Mess. Baker and Needham, Mr. Magny offers the
following</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Proposition.</span> All convex lenses of whatsoever foci, double
the apparent diameter of an object, provided that the object be at
the focus of the glass on one side, and the eye be at the same
distance, or on the focus of the glass, at the opposite side.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Experiment.</span> Take a double convex lens, of six or eight
inches focus, and fix it as at A, Fig. 1, <a href="#Plate2A">Plate II. A</a>, into the piece
A, which is fixed perpendicular to the rule F G, and may be slid
along it by means of its socket: the rule is divided into inches and
parts. Paste a piece of white paper, two or three tenths of an
inch broad, and three inches long, on the board D; draw three
lines with ink on this piece of paper, so as to divide it into four
equal parts, taking care that the middle of the paper corresponds
with the center of the lens. There is also a sliding eye-piece,
which is represented at e.</p>

<p>Take this apparatus into the darkest part of the room, but opposite
to the window; direct the glass towards any remarkable
and distant object which is out of doors, and move the sliding
piece B, until the image of the object on the paper be sharp and
clear. The distance between the face of the paper and the lens
(which is shewn on the side of the rule by the divisions thereon)
is the focus of the glass; now set the eye-piece e E to the same
distance on the other side of the glass, then with one eye close to
the sight at e, look at the magnified image of the lines, and with
the other eye at the lines themselves: the image, seen by means
of the glass, and expressed in the figure by the dotted lines, will
be double the breadth of the same object seen by the natural eye.
This will be found to be true, whatsoever is the focus of the lens
with which the experiment is made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page52">[52]</span></p>

<p>This experiment is rendered more simple to those who are not
accustomed to observe with both eyes at the same time, by making
use of half a lens, and placing the diameter perpendicular to
the rule, as they may then readily view the magnified image and
real object with the same glance of the eye, and thus compare
them together with ease and accuracy.</p>

<p>Let the angle A F B, Fig. 3. <a href="#Plate2A">Plate II. A</a>, represent that which
is formed at the naked eye, by the rays of light which pass from
the extremities of the object, and unite at the eye in the point F.
The angle D F E is formed of the two rays, which at first proceeded
parallel to each other from the extremities of the object,
but that were afterwards so refracted, or bent, by passing through
the glass, as to unite at its focal point F. C O is equal to the focal
distance of the lens on the side next the object, C F equal thereto
on the side next the eye, F O the distance of the eye.</p>

<p>From the allowed principles of optics, it is evident, that the
object would appear double the size to the eye at C, than it would
to the eye when placed at F; because the distance F O is double
the distance C O. We have only to prove then, that the angle
A C B is equal to the angle I F K, in order to establish the proposition.</p>

<p>The optical axis is perpendicular to the glass and the surface of
the object. The rays A I, B K, which flow from the points A B
are parallel to each other, and perpendicular to the glass, till they
arrive at it; they are then refracted and proceed to F, where they
form the triangle I F K, resting on the base I K: now as C F is
equal to C O, and I K is equal to A B, the two triangles A C B,
I F K are similar, and consequently the angle at C is equal to the
angle F. If the visual rays are continued to the surface of the
object, they will form the triangle D F E, equiangled to the triangle<span class="pagenum" id="Page53">[53]</span>
A B C; and therefore, as C O is to A B, so is F D to D E;
and consequently, the apparent diameter of the object seen
through the lens is double the size that it is when viewed by the
naked eye. No notice is here taken of the double refraction of
the rays, as it does not affect the demonstration.</p>

<p>If you advance towards M, half the focal distance, the apparent
diameter will be only increased one-third. If, on the contrary,
the point of sight is lengthened to double the distance of its focus,
then the magnified diameter will appear to be three times that of
the real object. Mr. Magny concludes from hence, that there is
an impropriety in estimating the magnifying power of the eye
glass of compound microscopes, by seeing how often its focus is
contained in eight or ten inches; and to obviate these defects, he
recommends two methods to be used, which reciprocally confirm
each other.</p>

<p>The first and most simple method to find how much any compound
microscope magnifies an object, is the same which is described
by Dr. Hooke in his Micrographia, and is as follows:
place an accurate scale, which is divided into very minute parts
of an inch, on the stage of your microscope; adjust the microscope,
till these divisions appear distinct; then observe with the
other eye how many divisions of a rule, similarly divided and held
at the stage, are included in one of the magnified divisions: for
if one division, as seen with one eye through the microscope, extend
to thirty divisions on the rule, which is seen by the naked
eye, it is evident, that the diameter of the object is increased or
magnified thirty times.</p>

<p>For this purpose, we often use a small black ebony rule, (see
Fig. 4. <a href="#Plate2A">Plate II. A</a>,) three or four tenths of an inch broad, and
about seven inches long; at each inch is fixed a piece of ivory,<span class="pagenum" id="Page54">[54]</span>
the first inch is entirely of ivory, and subdivided into ten equal
parts.</p>

<p>2. A piece of glass, Fig. 2, fixed in a brass or ivory slider; on
the diameter of this are drawn two parallel lines, about three-tenths
of an inch long; each tenth being divided, one into three,
the second into four, the third into five parts. To use this, place
the glass, Fig. 2, on the middle of the stage, and the rule, Fig. 4,
on one side, but parallel to it; then look into the microscope with
one eye, keeping the other open, and observe how many parts
one-tenth of a line in the microscope takes in upon the parts of
the rule seen by the naked eye. For instance, suppose with a
fourth magnifier that one-tenth of an inch magnified answers in
length to forty-tenths or parts on the rule, when seen by the
naked eye, then this magnifier increases the diameter of the object
forty times.</p>

<p>This mode of actual admeasurement is, without doubt, the
most simple that can be used; by it we comprehend, as it were,
at one glance, the different effects of combined glasses; it saves
the trouble, and avoids the obscurity that attends the usual modes
of calculation; but many persons find it exceedingly difficult to
adopt this method, because they have not been accustomed to
observe with both eyes at once. We shall therefore proceed to
describe another method, which has not this inconvenience.</p>

<h3>OF THE NEEDLE MICROMETER.</h3>

<p>Fig. 8. <a href="#Plate2A">Plate II. A</a>, represents this micrometer. The first of
this kind was made by my father, and was described by him in
his Micrographia Illustrata. It consists of a screw, which has
fifty threads to an inch; this screw carries an index, which points
to the divisions on a circular plate, which is fixed at right angles<span class="pagenum" id="Page55">[55]</span>
to the axis of the screw. The revolutions of the screw are
counted on a scale, which is an inch divided into fifty parts; the
index to these divisions is a flower de luce marked upon the slider,
which carries the needle point across the field of the microscope.
Every revolution of the micrometer screw measures <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>50</sub> part of an
inch, which is again subdivided by means of the divisions on the
circular plate, as this is divided into twenty equal parts, over
which the index passes at every revolution of the screw; by
which means, we obtain with ease the measure of one-thousandth
part of an inch; for 50, the number of threads on the
screw in one inch, being multiplied by 20, the divisions on the
circular plate, are equal to 1000; so that each division on the circular
plate shews that the needle has either advanced or receded
one-thousandth part of an inch.</p>

<p>To place this micrometer on the body of the microscope, open
the circular part F K H, Fig. 8. <a href="#Plate2A">Plate II. A</a>, by taking out the
screw G, throw back the semicircle F K which moves upon a
joint at K, then turn the sliding tube of the body of the microscope,
so that the small holes which are in both tubes may exactly
coincide, and let the needle g of the micrometer have a free
passage through them; after this, screw it fast upon the body by
the screw G.</p>

<p>The needle will now traverse the field of the microscope, and
measure the length and breadth of the image of any object that is
applied to it. But further assistance must be had, in order to
measure the object itself, which is a subject of real importance;
for though we have ascertained the power of the microscope, and
know that it is so many thousand times, yet this will be of little
assistance towards ascertaining an accurate idea of its real size;
for our ideas of bulk being formed by the comparison of one object
with another, we can only judge of that of any particular<span class="pagenum" id="Page56">[56]</span>
body, by comparing it with another whose size is known: the
same thing is necessary, in order to form an estimate by the
microscope; therefore, to ascertain the real measure of the object,
we must make the point of the needle pass over the image of a
known part of an inch placed on the stage, and write down the
revolutions made by the screw, while the needle passed over the
image of this known measure; by which means we ascertain the
number of revolutions on the screw, which are adequate to a real
and known measure on the stage. As it requires an attentive eye
to watch the motion of the needle point, as it passes over the
image of a known part of an inch on the stage, we ought not to
trust to one single measurement of the image, but ought to repeat
it at least six times; then add the six measures thus obtained together,
and divide their sum by six, or the number of trials; the
quotient will be the mean of all the trials. This result is to be
placed in a column of a table, next to that which contains the
number of the magnifiers.</p>

<p>By the assistance of the sectoral scale, we obtain with ease a
small part of an inch. This scale is shewn at Fig. 5, 6, 7. <a href="#Plate2A">Plate
II. A</a>, in which the two lines c&#8202;a c&#8202;b, with the side a&#8202;b, form an
isosceles triangle; each of the sides is two inches long, and the
base one-tenth of an inch. The longer sides may be of any given
length, and the base still only of one-tenth of an inch. The
longer lines may be considered as the line of lines upon a sector
opened to one-tenth of an inch. Hence, whatever number of
equal parts c&#8202;a c&#8202;b are divided into, their transverse measure will
be such a part of one-tenth as is expressed by their divisions.
Thus, if it be divided into ten equal parts, this will divide the
inch into one-hundred equal parts; the first division next c will
be equal to one-hundredth part of an inch, because it is the tenth
part of one-tenth of an inch. If these lines be divided into
twenty equal parts, the inch will be by those means divided into<span class="pagenum" id="Page57">[57]</span>
two hundred equal parts. Lastly, if a&#8202;b c&#8202;a be made three
inches long, and divided into one-hundred equal parts, we obtain
with ease the one-thousandth part. The scale is represented as
solid at Fig. 6, but as perforated at Fig. 5 and 7; so that the light
passes through the aperture, when the sectoral part is placed on
the stage.</p>

<p>To use this scale, first fix the micrometer, Fig. 8. <a href="#Plate2A">Plate II. A</a>,
to the body of the microscope; then fit the sectoral scale, Fig. 7,
in the stage, and adjust the microscope to its proper focus or distance
from the scale, which is to be moved till the base appears
in the middle of the field of view; then bring the needle point g,
Fig. 8, by turning the screw L, to touch one of the lines c a exactly
at the point answering to 20 on the sectoral scale. The
index a of the micrometer, Fig. 8, is to be set to the first division,
and that on the dial plate to 20, which is both the beginning and
end of its divisions; we are then prepared to find the magnifying
power of every magnifier in the compound microscope which we
are using.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Example.</span> Every thing being prepared agreeable to the foregoing
directions, suppose you are desirous of ascertaining the
magnifying power of the lens marked No. 4; turn the micrometer
screw, until the point of the needle has passed over the magnified
image of the tenth part of one inch; then the division, where the
two indices remain, will shew how many revolutions, and parts
of a revolution, the screw has made, while the needle point
traversed the magnified image of the one-tenth of an inch; suppose
the result to be twenty-six revolutions of the screw, and
fourteen parts of another revolution, this is equal to 26 multiplied
by 20, added to 14; that is, 534 thousandth parts of an
inch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page58">[58]</span></p>

<p>The twenty-six divisions found on the strait scale of the micrometer,
while the point of the needle passed over the magnified
image of one-tenth part of an inch, were multiplied by 20, because
the circular plate C D, Fig. 8, is divided into twenty equal
parts; this produced 520; then adding the fourteen parts of the
next revolution, we obtain 534 thousandth parts of an inch, or
5-tenths and 34-hundredth parts of another tenth, which is the
measure of the magnified image of 1-tenth of an inch, at the
aperture of the eye glasses, or at their foci. Now if we suppose
the focus of the two eye-glasses to be one inch, the double thereof
is two inches; or if we reckon in the thousandth part of an
inch, we have two thousand parts for the distance of the eye
from the needle point of the micrometer. Again, if we take the
distance of the image from the object at the stage at six inches,
or six thousandths, and add thereto two thousand, double the
distance of the focus of the eye glass, we shall have eight thousand
parts of an inch for the distance of the eye from the object;
and as from the proposition, <a href="#Page51">page 51</a>, we gather that the glasses
double the image, we must double the number 534 found upon
the micrometer, which then makes 1068: then, by the following
analogy, we shall obtain the number of times the microscope
magnifies the diameter of the object; say, as 240, the distance of
the eye from the image of the object, is to 800, the distance of
the eye from the object, so is 1068, double the measure found on
the micrometer, to 3563, or the number of times the microscope
magnifies the diameter of the object. By working in this manner,
the magnifying power of each lens used with the compound
microscope may be easily found, though the result will be different
in different compound microscopes, varying, according to the
combination of the lenses, their distance from the object, and
one another, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page59">[59]</span></p>

<p>Having discovered the magnifying power of the microscope,
with the different object lenses that are used therewith, our next
subject is to find out the real size of the objects themselves, and
their different parts; this is easily effected, by finding how many
revolutions of the micrometer-screw answer to a known measure
on the sectoral scale, or other object placed on the stage; from
the number thus found, a table should be constructed, expressing
the value of the different revolutions of the micrometer with that
object lens, by which the primary number was obtained. Similar
tables must be constructed for each object lens. By a set
of tables of this kind, the observer may readily find the measure
of any object he is examining; for he has only to make the needle
point traverse over this object, and observe the number of revolutions
the screw has made in its passage, and then look into his
table for the real measure which corresponds to this number of
revolutions, which is the measure required.</p>

<h3>ACCOUNT OF GLASS, PEARL, &amp;c. MICROMETERS,
BY THE EDITOR.</h3>

<p>Having seen some glass, &amp;c. micrometers with exquisite fine
divisions, for the purposes of applying to microscopes and telescopes;
and in accuracy, being equivalent to the micrometer just
described by our author, I judge, some account of their application
and uses here will be very acceptable to the curious and
inquisitive reader. A particular description of these as made by
the ingenious Mr. Coventry, has been already given in the Encyclop&aelig;dia
Britannica, Vol. XI. p. 708.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page60">[60]</span></p>

<p>The singular dexterity which Mr. Coventry and others now
possess, of cutting by an engine fine parallel lines upon glass,
pearl, ivory, and brass, at such minute distances as, by means of
a microscope, are proved to be from the 100th to the 5000dth
part of an inch, render this sort of micrometer the easiest and
most accurate means of obtaining the exact natural size of the
object to be magnified, and how many times that object is magnified.
Mr. B. Martin, and other opticians, many years ago applied
divided slips of glass, ivory, and horn to the body, in the
focus of the eye glass of microscopes; but the thickness of the
whole medium of the glass was found to diminish the distinct
view of the object: ivory and horn, from their variable texture,
were found to expand and contract too readily to be commodious.
It is therefore to Mr. Cavallo that we are indebted for the happy
thought of adapting slips of divided pearl to telescopes, to ascertain
their power, &amp;c. which substance the opticians now find
to be the best for microscopical micrometers. It possesses a
sufficient degree of transparency, when made about the thickness
of writing paper; is a steady substance; admits very easily of
the finest graduations, and is generally made in breadth about
the 20th part of an inch.</p>

<p>Fig. 9. <a href="#Plate2A">Plate II. A</a>, is a representation of this scale, with divisions
of the 200ths of an inch, every fifth and tenth division
being left longer than the others, which only go to about the
middle. If the eye glass of the microscope or telescope, to
which this micrometer is to be applied, magnify very much, its
divisions may be proportionably minute.</p>

<p>To measure by this micrometer the size of an object in a single
microscope, nothing more is required than to lay it on the micrometer,
and adjust it to the focus of the magnifier, noticing how<span class="pagenum" id="Page61">[61]</span>
many divisions it covers or coincides with. Supposing the parallel
lines to be the 1000dths of an inch, and the object covers
two divisions, its real size is the 500th of an inch; if five, 200th
of an inch, &amp;c.</p>

<p>To find how much the object is magnified, is not so easily done
by the single, as by the compound microscope, as has been before
explained. The following simple method has been adopted by
Mr. Coventry, and which may be considered tolerably accurate.
Adjust a micrometer under the microscope, suppose 100th of an
inch of divisions, with a small object on it, if square, the better;
notice how many divisions one side of the object covers, suppose
ten; then cut a piece of white paper something larger than the
magnified appearance of the object; fix one eye on the object
through the microscope, and the other at the same time on the
paper, lowering it down till the object and the paper appear level
and distinct: then cut the paper till it appear exactly the size of
the magnified object; the paper being then measured, suppose an
inch square: now, as the object under the magnifier, which appeared
to be one inch square, was in reality only ten hundredths,
or the tenth of an inch, the experiment proves that it is magnified
ten times in length, one hundred times in superficies, and one
thousand times in cube, which is the magnifying power of the
glass; and in the same manner a table may be made of the power
of all the other glasses.</p>

<p>In using the compound microscope, the real size of the object
is found by the same method as in the single; but to demonstrate
the magnifying power to greater certainty, adopt the following
method. Lay a two-feet rule on the stage, and a micrometer
level with its surface, (an inch suppose, divided into 100 parts:)
with one eye see how many of those parts are contained in the
field of the microscope, suppose 50; and with the other, at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page62">[62]</span>
same time, look for the circle of light in the field of the microscope,
which with a little practice will soon appear distinct; mark
how much of the rule, from the center of the stage, is intersected
by the circle of light, which will be half the diameter of the field.
Suppose eight inches; consequently the whole diameter will be
sixteen. Now, as the real size of the field by the micrometers
appeared to be only 50 hundredths, or half an inch, and as half
an inch is only one 32d part of 16 inches, it shews the magnifying
power to be 32 times in length, 1024 superficies, and 32768
in cube or bulk. For accuracy, as well as for comparative observations,
the rule should always be a certain distance from the eye;
eight inches in general is a proper distance.</p>

<p>Another way, and the most easy for finding the magnifying
power of compound microscopes, is by using two micrometers of
the same divisions; one adjusted under the magnifier, the other
fixed in the body of the microscope in the focus of the eye glass.
Notice how many divisions of the micrometer in the body are
seen in one division of the micrometer under the magnifier, which
again must be multiplied by the power of the eye glass. Example:
Ten divisions of the micrometer in the body are contained
in one division under the magnifier; so far the power is increased
ten times: now, if the eye glass be one inch focus, such glass will
of itself magnify about eight times in length, which, with the ten
times magnified before, will be eight times ten, or 80 times in
length, 6400 superficies, and 512000 cube.</p>

<p>Fig. 10. <a href="#Plate2A">Plate II. A</a>, represents the field of view of the compound
microscope, with the pearl micrometer, as applied to the
aperture in the body, called the eye stop; and a magnified micrometer
that is laid on the stage, shewing that one of the latter contains
ten of the former.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page63">[63]</span></p>

<p>A set of ivory and glass micrometers, about six in number, besides
one or two pearl ones for the eye stops, are generally packed
up with the best sort of microscopes made by Messrs. W. and S.
Jones, Opticians, Holborn. They are divided into lines and squares,
from the 100th to the 1000dth parts of an inch; and, besides
measuring the magnifying powers of microscopes, are generally
found useful in measuring the diameters, proportions, &amp;c. of
opake and transparent objects, even of the minutest kind. The
smallest divisions of the glass micrometer to be useful, are those
divided into the 4000dth part of an inch; and as these may be
crossed again with an equal number of lines in the same manner,
they form squares of the <span class="smcapall">SIXTEEN MILLIONTH</span> part of an inch
surface, each square of which appearing under the microscope
true and distinct. And, even small as this is, animalcul&aelig; are
found so minute as to be contained in one of these squares!</p>

<p>Glass micrometers with squares, applied to the solar microscope,
divide the objects into squares on the screen in such a manner,
as to render a drawing from it very easy; and are employed
with great advantage in the lucernal microscope.</p>

<p>The micrometers are constructed with moveable frames or
tubes, so as to be either applied or taken away in the readiest
manner.</p>

<p>For the uses of the pearl micrometer as applied to the telescope,
see Mr. Cavallo&#8217;s pamphlet descriptive of its use, 8vo. 1793,
and the Philosophical Transactions for 1791.</p>

<h2><span class="chapno">CHAP. III.</span><br />
<span class="chapname">A DESCRIPTION OF THE MOST APPROVED MICROSCOPES, AND
THE METHOD OF USING THEM.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="startcapital">I</span>n the preceding chapter I have endeavoured to give a comprehensive
view of the theory of the microscope, and the principles
on which the wonderful effects of this instrument depend. I
shall now proceed to describe the various instruments themselves,
their apparatus, and the most easy and ready mode of
applying them to use; selecting for description those that, from
some peculiar advantage in their construction, or from the reputation
of the authors who have recommended and used them, are
in most general use. What is said of these will, I hope, be sufficient
to enable the reader to manage any other kind that may
fall in his way.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">DESCRIPTION OF ADAMS&#8217;S IMPROVED AND UNIVERSAL LUCERNAL
MICROSCOPE.</span> Fig. 1. <a href="#Plate3">Plate III.</a></h3>

<p>This microscope was originally thought of, and in part executed
by my father; I have, however, so improved and altered
it, both in construction and form, as to render it altogether a
different instrument. The approbation it has received from the
most experienced microscopic observers, as well as the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page65">[65]</span>
demand I have had for them, has fully repaid my pains and
expenses, in bringing it to its present state of perfection.</p>

<p>As the far greater part of the objects which surround us are
opake, and very few sufficiently transparent to be examined
by the common microscopes, an instrument that could be readily
applied to the examination of opake objects, has always been a
desideratum. Even in the examination of transparent objects,
many of the fine and more curious portions are lost, and drowned
as it were in the light which must be transmitted through them;
while different parts of the same object appear only as dark lines
or spots, because they are so opake, as not to permit any light to
pass through them. These difficulties, as well as many more, are
obviated in the lucernal microscope; by which opake objects of
various sizes may be seen with ease and distinctness; the beautiful
colours with which most of them are adorned, are rendered
more brilliant, without in the least changing their natural teints.
The concave and convex parts of an object retain also their
proper form.</p>

<p>The facility with which all opake objects are applied to this
instrument is another considerable advantage, and almost peculiar
to itself; as the texture and configuration of the more tender
parts are often hurt by previous preparation, every object may
be examined by this instrument, first as opake, and afterwards,
if the texture will admit of it, as transparent.</p>

<p>The lucernal microscope does not in the least fatigue the eye;
the object appears like nature itself, giving ease to the sight, and
pleasure to the mind: there is also in the use of this instrument, no
occasion to shut that eye which is not directed to the object.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page66">[66]</span></p>

<p>A further advantage peculiar to this microscope is, that by it
the outlines of every object may be taken, even by those who are
not accustomed to draw; while those who can draw well, will
receive great assistance, and execute their work with more accuracy,
and in less time than they would otherwise have been able
to have performed it in. Most of the designs for this work were
taken with the lucernal microscope; and I hope the accuracy
with which they are executed, will be deemed a sufficient testimony
in favour of the instrument. In this point of view it will,
I think, be found of great use to the anatomist, the botanist, the
entomologist, &amp;c. as it will enable them not only to investigate
the object of their researches, but to convey to others accurate
delineations of the subject they wish to describe.</p>

<p>By the addition of a tin lanthorn, transparent objects may be
shewn on a screen, as by the solar microscope.</p>

<p>Transparent objects may be examined with this instrument in
three or four different modes; from a blaze of light almost too
great for the eye to bear, to that which is perfectly easy to it.</p>

<p>When this instrument is fitted up in the best way, it is generally
accompanied with a small double and single microscope.</p>

<p>Fig. 1. <a href="#Plate3">Plate III.</a> represents the
<span class="smcapall">IMPROVED LUCERNAL MICROSCOPE</span>,
mounted to view opake objects; A B C D E is a large mahogany
pyramidical box, about fourteen inches long, and six
inches square at its larger end, which forms the body of the
microscope; it is supported firmly on the brass pillar F G, by
means of the socket H, and the curved piece I K.</p>

<p>L M N is a guide for the eye, in order to direct it in the axis of
the lenses; it consists of two brass tubes, one sliding within the<span class="pagenum" id="Page67">[67]</span>
other, and a vertical flat piece, at the top of which is the hole for
the eye. The outer tube is seen at M N, the vertical piece is represented
at L M. The inner tube may be pulled out, or pushed
in, to adjust it to the focus of the glasses. The vertical piece
may be raised or depressed, that the hole, through which the
object is to be viewed, may coincide with the center of the field
of view; it is fixed by a milled screw at M, which could not be
shewn in this figure.</p>

<p>At N is a dove-tailed piece of brass, made to receive the dove-tail
at the end of the tubes M N, by which it is affixed to the
wooden box A B C D E. The tubes M N may be removed from
this box occasionally, for the convenience of packing it up in a
less compass.</p>

<p>O P a small tube on which the magnifiers are screwed.</p>

<p>O one of the magnifiers; it is screwed into the end of a tube,
which slides within the tube P; the tube P may be unscrewed
occasionally from the wooden body.</p>

<p>Q R S T V X a long square bar, which passes through the sockets
Y Z, and carries the stage or frame that holds the objects; this
bar may be moved backward or forward, in order to adjust it to
the focus, by means of the pinion which is at a.</p>

<p>b e is a handle furnished with an universal joint, for more conveniently
turning the pinion. When the handle is removed, the
nut, Fig. 2, may be used in its stead.</p>

<p>d e is a brass bar, to support the curved piece K I, and keep the
body A B firm and steady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page68">[68]</span></p>

<p>f g h i is the stage for opake objects; it fits upon the bar
Q R S T by means of the socket h i, and is brought nearer to, or
removed farther from the magnifying lens, by turning the pinion a;
the objects are placed in the front side of the stage, which cannot
be seen in this figure, between four small brass plates; the edges
of two of these are seen at k l. The two upper pieces of brass
are moveable; they are fixed to a plate, which is acted on by a
spiral spring that presses them down, and confines the slider with
the objects; this plate, and the two upper pieces of brass, are
lifted up by the small nut m.</p>

<p>At the lower part of the stage, there is a glass semiglobe n,
which is designed to receive the light from the lamp, Fig. 3,
and to collect and convey it to the concave mirror o, from
whence it is to be reflected on the object.</p>

<p>The upper part, f g r S, of the opake stage takes out, that the
stage for transparent objects may be inserted in its place.</p>

<p>Fig. 4. represents the stage for transparent objects; the two
legs 5 and 6, fit into the under part r S of the stage for
opake objects; 7 is the part which confines or holds the sliders,
and through which they are to be moved; 9 and 10 a brass tube,
which contains the lenses for condensing the light, and throwing
it upon the object; there is a second tube within that, marked
9 and 10, which may be placed at different distances from the
object by the pin 11.</p>

<p>When this stage is used as a single microscope, without any
reference to the lucernal, the magnifiers or object lenses are to be
screwed into the hole 12, and to be adjusted to a proper focus by
the nut 13.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page69">[69]</span></p>

<p>N. B. At the end A B of the wooden body there is a slider,
which is represented as partly drawn out at A; when quite taken
out, three grooves will be perceived, one of which contains a
board that forms the end of the box, the next contains a frame
with a greyed glass; the third, or that farthest from the end A B,
two large convex lenses.</p>

<h4>OF THE LAMP.</h4>

<p>Fig. 3, represents one of Argand&#8217;s lamps, which is the most
suitable for microscopic purposes, on account of the clearness, the
intensity, and the steadiness of the light. The following method
of managing it, with other observations, is copied from an account
given by Mr. Parker, with those he sells.</p>

<p>The principle on which the lamp acts, consists in disposing the
wick in thin parts, so that the air may come into contact with all
the burning fuel, by which means, together with an increase of
the current of air occasioned by rarefaction in the glass tube, the
whole of the fuel is converted into flame.</p>

<p>The wicks are circular, and, the more readily to regulate the
quantity of light, are fixed on a brass collar with a wire handle,
by means of which they are raised or depressed at pleasure.</p>

<p>To fix the wick on, a wood mandril is contrived, which is tapered
at one end, and has a groove turned at the other.</p>

<p>The wick has a selvage at one end, which is to be put foremost
on the mandril, and moved up to the groove; then putting the
groove into the collar of the wick-holder, the wick is easily
pushed forward upon it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page70">[70]</span></p>

<p>The wick-holder and wick being put quite down in their place,
the spare part of the wick should, while dry, be set alight, and
suffered to burn to the edge of the tubes; this will leave it more
even than by cutting, and, being black by burning, will be much
easier lighted: for this reason, the black should never be intirely
cut off.</p>

<p>The lamp should be filled an hour or two before it is wanted,
that the cotton may imbibe the oil, and draw the better.</p>

<p>The lamps which have a reservoir and valve, need no other
direction for filling, than to do it with a proper trimming pot,
carefully observing when they are full; then pulling up the valve
by the point, the reservoir being turned by the other hand, may
be replaced without spilling a drop.</p>

<p>Those lamps which fill in the front like a bird-fountain, must
be reclined on the back to fill, and this should be done gently,
that the oil in the burner may return into the body when so
placed and filled; if, by being too full, any oil appear above the
guard, only move the lamp a little, and the oil will disappear;
the lamp may then be placed erect, and the oil will flow to its
proper level.</p>

<p>The oil must be of the spermaceti kind, commonly called
chamber oil, which may generally be distinguished by its paleness,
transparency, and inoffensive scent; all those oils which are
of a red and brown colour, and of an offensive smell, should be
carefully avoided, as their glutinous parts clog the lamp, and the
impurities in such oil not being inflammable, will accumulate and
remain in the form of a crust on the wick. Seal oil is nearly as
pale and sweet as chamber oil, but being of a heavy sluggish quality,
is not proper for lamps with fine wicks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page71">[71]</span></p>

<p>Whenever bad oil has been used, on changing it, the wick must
also be changed, because, after having imbibed the coarse particles
in its capillary tubes, it will not draw up the fine oil.</p>

<p>To obtain the greatest degree of light, the wick should be trimmed
exactly even, the flame will then be completely equal.</p>

<p>There will be a great advantage in keeping the lamp clean,
especially the burner and air tubes; the neglect of cleanliness in
lamps is too common: a candlestick is generally cleaned every
time it is used, so should a lamp; and if a candlestick is not to be
objected to, because it does not give light after the candle is exhausted,
so a lamp should not be thought ill of, if it does not
give light when it wants oil or cotton; but this last has often
happened, because the deficiency is less visible.</p>

<p>The glass tubes are best cleaned with a piece of wash leather.</p>

<p>If a fountain lamp be left partly filled with oil, it may be liable
to overflow; this happens by the contraction of the air when
cold, and its expansion by the warmth of a room, the rays of
the sun, or the heat of the lamp when re-lighted: this accident
may be effectually prevented by keeping the reservoir filled, the
oil not being subject to expansion like air. On this account,
those with a common reservoir are best adapted for microscopic
purposes.</p>

<h4>TO EXAMINE OPAKE OBJECTS WITH THE LUCERNAL
MICROSCOPE.</h4>

<p>The microscope is represented as mounted, and entirely ready
for this purpose, in Fig. 1. <a href="#Plate3">Plate III.</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page72">[72]</span></p>

<p>To render the use of this instrument easy, it is usually packed
with as many of the parts together as possible; it occupies on this
account rather more room, but is much less embarrassing to the
observer, who has only three parts to put on after it is taken
out of its box, namely, the guide for the eye, the stage, and the
tube with its magnifier.</p>

<p>But to be more particular, take out the wooden slide A, then
lift out the cover and the grey glass from their respective grooves
under the slide A.</p>

<p>Put the end N of the guide for the eye L M N into its place, so
that it may stand in the position which is represented in this
figure.</p>

<p>Place the socket, which is at the bottom of the opake stage,
on the bar Q X T, so that the concave mirror o may be next the
end D E of the wooden body.</p>

<p>Screw the tubes P O into the end D E. The magnifier you
intend to use is to be screwed on the end o of these tubes.</p>

<p>The handle G b, or milled nut, Fig. 2, must be placed on the
square end of the pinion a.</p>

<p>Place the lamp lighted before the glass lump n, and the object
you intend to examine between the spring plates of the stage,
and the instrument is ready for use.</p>

<p>In all microscopes, there are two circumstances which must be
particularly attended to; the modification of the light, or the
proper quantity to illuminate the object; secondly, the adjustment<span class="pagenum" id="Page73">[73]</span>
of the instrument to the focus of the glasses and the eye of
the observer. In the use of the lucernal microscope there is a
third circumstance, which is the regulation of the guide of the
eye, each of which I shall consider by itself.</p>

<p>1. To throw the light upon the object. The flame of the lamp
is to be placed rather below the center of the glass semiglobe n, and
as near it as possible; the concave mirror o must be so inclined
and turned, as to receive the light from the semiglobe; and reflect
it thence upon the object; the best situation of the concave mirror,
and the flame of the lamp, depends on a combination of circumstances,
which a little practice will best point out.</p>

<p>2. To regulate the guide for the eye, or to place the center of
the eye piece L, so that it may coincide with the focal point of
the lenses, and the axis of vision. Lengthen and shorten the
tubes M N by drawing out or pushing in the inner tube, and
raising or depressing the eye-piece M L, till you find the large
lens, which is placed at the end A B of the wooden body, filled
by an uniform field of light, without any prismatic colours round
the edge; for, till this piece be properly fixed, the circle of
light will be very small, and only occupy a part of the lens;
the eye must be kept at the center of the eye-piece L, during the
whole of the operation; which may be rendered somewhat easier
to the observer, on the first use of the instrument, if he hold a
piece of white paper parallel to the large lenses, removing it from
or bringing it nearer to them, till he finds the place where a
lucid circle, which he will perceive on the paper, is brightest and
most distinct, then to fix the center of the eye-piece to coincide
with that spot; after which a very small adjustment will set it
perfectly right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page74">[74]</span></p>

<p>3. To adjust the lenses to their focal distance. This is effected
by turning the pinion a, the eye being at the same time at the
eye-piece L. I often place the grey glass before the large lenses,
while I am regulating the guide for the eye, and adjusting for
the focal distance.</p>

<p>If the observer, in the process of his examination of an object,
advance rapidly from a shallow to a deep magnifier, he will save
himself some labour by pulling out the internal tube at O.</p>

<p>The upper part f g r s of the stage, is to be raised or lowered
occasionally, in order to make the center of the object coincide
with the center of the lens at O.</p>

<p>To delineate objects, the grey or rough ground glass must be
placed before the large lenses; the picture of the object will be
formed on this glass, and the outline may be accurately taken,
by going over the picture with a pencil.</p>

<p>The opake part may be used in the day-time without a lamp,
provided the large lenses at A B be screened from the light.</p>

<h4>TO USE THE LUCERNAL MICROSCOPE IN THE EXAMINATION
OF TRANSPARENT OBJECTS.</h4>

<p>The microscope is to remain as before: the upper part f g r s of
the opake stage must be removed, and the stage for transparent
objects, represented at Fig. 4, put in its place; the end, Fig. 9
and 10, to be next the lamp.</p>

<p>Place the rough glass in its groove at the end A B, and the
objects in the slider-holder at the front of the stage; then transmit<span class="pagenum" id="Page75">[75]</span>
as strong a light as you are able on the object, which you
will easily do, by raising or lowering the lamp.</p>

<p>The object will be beautifully depicted on the rough glass: it
must be regulated to the focus of the magnifier, by turning the
pinion a.</p>

<p>The object may be viewed either with or without the guide for
the eye; a single observer will see an object to the greatest advantage
by using this guide, which is to be adjusted as we have
described, <a href="#Page73">page 73</a>. If two or three wish to examine the object
at the same time, the guide for the eye must be laid aside.</p>

<p>Take the large lens out of the groove, and receive the image
on the rough glass; in this case the guide for the eye is of no use:
if the rough glass be taken away, the image of the object may be
represented on a paper screen.<a href="#Footnote29" id="FNanchor29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote29"><a href="#FNanchor29" class="label">[29]</a>
A tin cover is sometimes made to go over the glass chimney of the lamp, Fig. 3, with only
a small square aperture in front, sufficient to suffer the rays to pass into the microscope: this,
by excluding all extraneous rays, adds in many cases most materially to the effect, particularly
by day, and when objects are to be represented on the rough glass or screen only. <span class="smcap">Edit.</span></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Take out the rough glass, replace the large lenses, and use the
guide for the eye; attend to the foregoing directions, and adjust
the object to its proper focus. You will then see the object in a
blaze of light almost too great for the eye, a circumstance that
will be found very useful in the examination of particular objects;
the edges of the object in this mode will be somewhat coloured,
but as it is only used in this full light for occasional purposes, it
has been thought better to leave this small imperfection, than by
remedying it, to sacrifice greater advantages; the more so, as this
fault is easily corrected, and a new and interesting view of the
object is obtained, by turning the instrument out of the direct rays<span class="pagenum" id="Page76">[76]</span>
of light, and permitting them to pass through only in an oblique
direction, by which the upper surface is in some degree illuminated,
and the object is seen partly as opake, partly as transparent.
It has been already observed, that the transparent objects might
be placed between the slider-holders kl of the stage for opake
objects, and then be examined as if opake.</p>

<p>Some transparent objects appear to the greatest advantage when
the lens at 9 and 10 is taken away; as, by giving too great a
quantity of light, it renders the edges less sharp.</p>

<p>The variety of views which may be taken of every object, by
means of the improved lucernal microscope, will be found to be
of great use to an accurate observer: it will give him an opportunity
of correcting or confirming his discoveries, and investigating
those parts in one mode, which are invisible in another.</p>

<h4>TO TRANSMIT THE IMAGE OF TRANSPARENT OBJECTS ON A
SCREEN, AS BY THE SOLAR MICROSCOPE.</h4>

<p>It has been long a microscopical desideratum, to have an instrument
by which the image of transparent objects might be
shewn on a screen, as by the common solar microscope; and
this not only because the sun is so uncertain in this climate, and
the use of the solar microscope requires confinement in the finest
part of the day, when time seldom hangs heavy on the rational
mind, but as it also affords an increase of pleasure, by displaying
its wonders to several persons at the same instant, without the
least fatigue to the eye.</p>

<p>This purpose is now effectually answered, by affixing the transparent
stage, Fig. 4, of the lucernal to a lanthorn containing one
of Argand&#8217;s lamps. The lamp is placed within the lanthorn, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page77">[77]</span>
the end 9, 10 of the transparent stage is screwed into a female
screw, which is rivetted in the sliding part of the front of the lanthorn;
the magnifying lenses are to be screwed into the hole represented
at 12; they are adjusted by turning the milled nut. The
quantity of light is to be regulated, by raising and lowering the
sliding plate, or the lamp. N. B. This part, with its lanthorn and
lamp, may be had separate from the lucernal microscope.<a href="#Footnote30" id="FNanchor30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote30"><a href="#FNanchor30" class="label">[30]</a> This effect by the lanthorn
and lamp is subject to much limitation in the field of view, or
circle of light thrown upon the screen. A circle of not more than from 12 to about 15 inches
can ever be obtained with any tolerable strength of light, to shew the most transparent sort of
objects that can be found, such as the scale of a sole fish, a fly&#8217;s wing, &amp;c. The great difference
between the light of the sun and a lamp is a natural obstacle to great performances in this way,
and renders them far short of the effects of the solar microscope. The exhibition, however, is
considerable, and much deserving of the notice of any observer disposed to this sort of apparatus.
Probably, subsequent experiments may yet produce more light on this instrument. The best
sort of apparatus for this purpose hitherto made, I shall describe in a <a href="#Page80">following section</a>.

<h4>APPARATUS WHICH USUALLY ACCOMPANIES THE IMPROVED
LUCERNAL MICROSCOPE.</h4>

<p>The stage, Fig. 1, f g h i, for opake objects, with its glass semiglobe,
and concave mirror, which is moveable upon the bar Q R S T,
and set readily to any distance by the screw at a. The glasses
o and n are also moveable upon the bar for regulating and adjusting
the light upon the object.</p>

<p>The stage, Fig. 4, for transparent objects, which fits on the
upper part P S of the foregoing stage. When this is to be applied
occasionally to a lanthorn for shewing transparent objects
on a screen, &amp;c. it is made of a much larger diameter, to admit
of the illuminating lenses at 9, 10, and 11, of greater power of
condensing the rays from the lamp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page78">[78]</span></p>

<p>The sliding tube O P, to which the magnifiers are to be affixed;
one end of this is to be screwed on the end B of the wooden
body; the magnifier in use is to be screwed to the other end on
the inner tube. This tube slides inwards or outwards; it is first
used to set the magnifier at nearly the right distance from the
object, before the exact adjustment for the focus is made, by
turning the pinion at a with Hook&#8217;s joint and handle b e.</p>

<p>Eight magnifying lenses in brass cells, Fig. 5. <a href="#Plate3">Plate III.</a> these
are so constructed that any two of them may be combined together,
and thus produce a very great variety of magnifying
powers. The cells unscrew to admit of the glasses being
cleaned.</p>

<p>A fish-pan, such as is represented at Fig. 6, whereon a small
fish may be fastened in order to view the circulation of its blood;
its tail is to be spread across the oblong hole at the smallest end,
and tied fast by means of the attached ribbon. The knob on its
back is to be put through a slit hole on the brass piece, No. 5, of
Fig. 4. The tail of the fish is to be brought then immediately
before the magnifier.</p>

<p>A steel wire, Fig. 7, with a pair of nippers at one end, and a
steel point at the other; the wire slides backwards or forwards, in
a spring tube which is affixed to a joint at the bottom, on which
is a pin to fit the hole in the leg, No. 6, Fig. 4. This is used to
confine small objects.</p>

<p>A slider of brass, Fig. 8, containing a flat glass slider and a
brass slider, into which are fitted some small concave glasses. It
is for confining small living objects, and when used is placed between
the two plates, No. 7, Fig. 4.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page79">[79]</span></p>

<p>A pair of forceps, Fig. 9, by which any occasional small object
may be conveniently taken up.</p>

<p>Six large ivory sliders, with transparent objects placed between
two plates of talc, and confined by brass rings, and six small ditto
with ditto. Fig. 10. The larger ones usually contain a set of
Custance&#8217;s fine vegetable cuttings.</p>

<p>Fourteen wood sliders, containing on each four opake objects,
and two spare sliders for occasional objects; all fitted to the
cheeks kl of the stage. Fig. 11.</p>

<p>Some capillary tubes, Fig. 12, to receive small fish, and for
viewing small animalcula. They are to be placed between the
two plates of the stage No. 7, Fig. 4.</p>

<p>A small ivory double box, containing spare plates of talc and
brass rings, for replacing any in the small ivory sliders, when
necessary.</p>

<p>A single lens mounted in a tortoiseshell case, to examine minute
objects previous to their being applied to the sliders.</p>

<p>Opake objects are easily put on the spare sliders by a wetted
wafer; and, for good security, gum water may be added.</p>

<h3>A DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL IMPROVEMENTS MADE UPON
MR. ADAMS&#8217;S LUCERNAL MICROSCOPE. BY THE EDITOR.</h3>

<p>The lucernal microscope being unquestionably the only instrument
for exhibiting all sorts of opake objects under a brilliant
and magnified appearance, was, as formerly constructed by the
late Mr. G. Adams, attended with some inconveniences and imperfections.
Upon a proper inquiry into various improvements,
and from some observations made by myself, I can recommend,
as a complete instrument, one with the following emendations,
being, in my opinion, the best of any hitherto made known.</p>

<p>The lucernal microscope, when placed up for use, as represented
in Fig. 1. <a href="#Plate3">Plate III.</a> is of some considerable length. When
the eye at L is viewing the image of the object upon the glasses,
the objects themselves in the sliders placed at kl at the stage, are
without the reach of the hand; so that the indispensible change
of the parts of an object, or of one object to another, can only
be obtained by the observer&#8217;s moving himself from the object
to the eye-piece, and vice versa. This adjustment, therefore,
proves uncertain and troublesome. The application of rack-work
motion to the stage has been contrived and applied to the
lucernal microscope by Mr. W. Jones, of Holborn, accompanied
with Hooke&#8217;s joint and handle, and a lever rod; so that, without
altering his position, the observer may change both the horizontal
and vertical position of the sliders, and thereby readily
investigate all the variety of the objects, and their parts, and with
the same exactness as by other microscopes.</p>

<p>For persons who may not wish to be at the expense of the
lucernal, as formerly mounted by Mr. Adams, Mr. Jones has altered<span class="pagenum" id="Page81">[81]</span>
the manner of its support; which, as well as the other particulars,
and the method of using it, may be understood from the
following description.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate9">Plate IX.</a> Fig. 3, is a representation of the instrument as placed
up for use. AA, the top of a mahogany chest, about two feet
long, thirteen inches and an half high, and eight inches broad,
which serves both as a case to contain the instrument, and to
support and preserve it steady when in use. A groove is cut in
the top of the box, and another in the inside at the bottom, in
both of which the base of the instrument is made to slide. When
the instrument is placed inside, a long slip of mahogany slides in
at the top, to secure the groove, and make the top perfect. Thus
the instrument may be most readily slid out of its case, and then
into the groove at top for use, and in much less time than by the
brass frame and jointed stand adopted by Mr. Adams. Fig. 3
B, is the stage for the objects, with the condensing lens <i>a</i>, and
concave mirror <i>b</i>, the same as in Mr. Adams&#8217;s. C, the brass
slider case for opake objects, with a rack cut into its lower edge,
and which is turned by a pinion. To this pinion is applied an
handle, D, with Hooke&#8217;s universal joint; this contrivance gives a
certain horizontal motion to the objects while viewing. The
stage at C is also made to slide vertically, and a lever-rod or handle,
E, to apply through the top, to bring the objects to a just
height. Hence, by applying the left hand to the handle, E, and
the right to the rod D, the adjustment or the changing of the objects,
while under exhibition on the large lenses at F, is produced
in the most convenient and accurate manner, and the observer has
no occasion, for one slider, to shift from his seat or position.</p>

<p>Rack-work might be applied to the vertical motion, but it is
not essentially necessary; for when once the center of the slider is<span class="pagenum" id="Page82">[82]</span>
observed, there requires very little change from that position for
the complete exhibition of the objects. The whole of the
stage, with the lense and mirror, is fixed to a brass dove-tailed
slider at G, which slides in another brass piece fixed to the
wooden slider or base of the instrument. A long brass rod, H,
with an adjusting screw at its end, passes through the two brass
pillars, K, K, to the stage at <i>f</i>, upon which it acts; and according
as it is turned to the right or left hand while examining
the objects, moves the objects nearer to or farther from the magnifiers
screwed on at L, and produces the just distance for rendering
the appearance of the objects the most distinct and brilliant
upon the glasses at F.</p>

<p>The management of the light from the lamp, through the
lens, <i>a</i>, and from the concave mirror, <i>b</i>, to the objects, is exactly
the same as before directed by Mr. Adams. For the exhibiting
of transparent objects, the stage, C, is to be slid away, and the
body, Fig. 4, applied in its place, in that position, with the large
lens outwards next the lamp. The slider with the objects passes
through at <i>a</i>, and the focus for the different magnifiers is adjusted
by turning the long rod, D, to the right or left, as with the opake
objects. In this case the lamp is to be raised to the center
of the body of the microscope, or even with the magnifiers at L.
The image of the objects may also, as in Mr. Adams&#8217;s, be best
received on the rough glass placed at F, for the simple reflected
light through the body will sometimes be so strong, as to irritate
the eye; the operator must, therefore, both modify that from the
lamp, and place the roughed glass to his own ease and pleasure.
The guide for the eye, N, in this instance is not necessary. Care
being taken that the roughed glass at F be kept in as dark a
situation as possible, there will be a certainty of a clear and well-defined
view of the object.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page83">[83]</span></p>

<p>A tin chimney placed over the glass of the lamp about ten
inches long, with a suitable aperture to admit the light to pass
through it to the glasses, is of material service; it excludes all
superfluous light from the eye of the observer, keeps the room
sufficiently darkened, and enables the observer to view his object
with the proper brilliancy. As a pleasing relief to the eye, the
interposition of a small piece of blue or green glass at the sight
hole, N, Mr. Jones has sometimes found necessary, but it gives
rather a false teint to the colour of the objects.</p>

<p>In the year 1789 the same artist applied a brass screw pillar
and arm to the top of the box at O, on which is occasionally slid
the condensing lens, <i>a</i>. The lamp being then applied at the side of
the box at O, instead of the end, and the lens, <i>a</i>, moved to such
a distance as to give the strongest possible light upon the opake
objects at C; they were found to be more strongly illuminated by
this simple refracted light than by the refracted and reflected light
before used. Light is always somewhat diminished by reflection,
although condensed; therefore, as it is sometimes best to view
the objects from oblique reflected light, and sometimes from direct
refracted, he constructs the apparatus so as to give the operator
the means of easily using either. The dotted lines, O P,
shew the manner that the glass semiglobe, <i>a</i>, is occasionally
applied to refract or converge directly the light from the lamp to
the objects on the stage.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to observe to the reader, the propriety
of all the glasses of the apparatus being perfectly clean before the
observations; for if, after being laid aside some time, or by
dust, &amp;c. they should appear soiled, it will be necessary to wipe
them previously with a piece of soft shammy leather usually sent
in the box for that purpose, or a clean soft cloth. The two large<span class="pagenum" id="Page84">[84]</span>
lenses at F, Fig. 3, may be readily separated by turning aside
the two brass screws that act upon a brass ring.</p>

<p>From the various ingenious admirers of this sort of instrument,
many improvements and alterations have been suggested; among
several that have been communicated, those by the two following
gentlemen appear to me the most deserving of notice, and which
I shall leave to the reader&#8217;s judgment and experience.</p>

<p>The Rev. John Prince, LL. D. now of Salem, Massachuset&#8217;s
States, North America, a valuable correspondent and friend of
our late author, transmitted to him an alteration in the construction;
and of which I here insert the brief account, in nearly
the words given by Mr. Adams.</p>

<p>Dr. Prince applies a strong joint similar to that of a telescope at
about the middle of the center part of the pyramidical box, and a
sort of adjusting screw at the large end. The joint is nearly in
the center of gravity, so that a very small motion is sufficient to
bring any object less than an inch in diameter into the field of
view. This motion is effected by two screws at right angles to
each other; one screw raising or levelling the body, the other
moving it sidewise, the screw at the same time forming a double
joint to accommodate the parts to the movement.<a href="#Footnote31" id="FNanchor31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote31"><a href="#FNanchor31" class="label">[31]</a>
A figure of this, with an explanation, as recommended by Mr. John Hill, Wells, in Norfolk,
may be seen in the Gentleman&#8217;s Magazine, Vol. <span class="smcapall">LXVI</span>. 2d part, page 897. In this particular,
as well as in the deviation from the parallel position of the glasses to the surfaces of the objects,
I think the construction not so simple and perfect, as that by rack-work and pinion applied by
Mr. Jones. Probably, Dr. Prince had not, at the time of his contriving the joint-work to the
box, seen or heard of the other method. His subsequent contrivances shew real ingenuity; and
to the inquisitive in this instrument, will afford much useful entertainment and advantage.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>To secure the image formed upon the rough glass more completely
from the light, at times essentially necessary, there is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page85">[85]</span>
pyramidical mahogany box, of the same size, to pack, when not
used, in the body of the microscope; when in use, the broad end
of this screen box is to be slid into the groove, from which the
exterior cover at the end has been taken. This method is peculiarly
useful in the day-time; as, by screening the large lenses
from the light, it may even then be used with satisfaction.</p>

<p>One of the large lenses may occasionally be placed on the outer
edge of the screen box, the other lens being taken out; the view on
the rough glass is by these means magnified, and appears to greater
advantage. But, besides the grey glass used in the former construction,
there is a second in this, placed farther within the body,
about half way; and, when the large lens is in the screen box, objects
appear better in this than in the former way. It has a still
greater effect upon those who are unacquainted with the nature
of lenses, as it makes them judge the distance and magnitude
much greater than they really are, and is therefore more pleasing
than the grey glass in front. Only one grey glass can be used at
a time; both being removed when opake objects are viewed.</p>

<p>The stage, F, Fig. 5, is considerably different from that at C,
Fig. 3; it is judged more convenient and commodious than the
other, and serves, with a small alteration, for both transparent
and opake objects. A truncated cone can also be here applied
for cutting off superfluous rays of light occasionally.</p>

<p>The method of illuminating the objects is also different. The
mode now adopted answers better for opake and transparent objects,
throws a stronger light, and is more convenient in application.
It consists of two lenses, 1 and 2, Fig. 5; the larger one is
to be placed at the end of the bar next the lamp. The smaller one
to be adjusted so as to give a strong light. A third is also added,<span class="pagenum" id="Page86">[86]</span>
to be used occasionally with opake objects; it is to be applied
close to the large lens. Experience will shew when it is to be
used, or not. By moving the bar, G, on which these lenses are
placed round the stage pillar, M, you bring it so much fronting
the stage as effectually to enlighten opake objects by means of
the lamp. The light thus afforded is received directly, and none
lost by reflection. The objects are fixed on circular wheels of
wood, see Fig. 7, the brass centers of which, are fitted to the
hole, <i>b</i>, of the stage, Fig. 5; and about this center they are to be
turned by the hand for the changing of the objects.</p>

<p>As some objects, such as sections of wood, are seen to advantage
both as transparent and opake, a frame containing a plane
and a concave mirror is added to this instrument, serving two
purposes: by bringing the bar to the front of the stage, removing
the large lens, and putting the mirror in its place, the object may
be viewed either way, without moving from the seat, by turning
the instrument a little round. This experience will discover.
The light of the sun may be thrown by the plane mirror on the
condensing lens, so as to produce a strong full field of light on
the grey glass. This has a grand effect when the large lens is at
the end of the screen box, and could not be applied in this manner
in former constructions. It becomes also an opake solar microscope,
by turning the bar round to enlighten opake objects.</p>

<p>By bringing the concave mirror to a focus that will burn objects,
a set of very curious and entertaining experiments may be
made and exhibited on the grey glass. The object for combustion
should be put in the nippers, and a piece of slate tied as a ground
on the stage. The ebullition of a piece of alum viewed in this
manner is very beautiful; the bubbles, as they rise and pass off
rapidly, appear tinged with all the colours of the rainbow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page87">[87]</span></p>

<p>There are large-sized magnifiers for the purpose of throwing
transparent objects on a screen, in imitation of the solar microscope.
By removing the large lenses in front and the grey glass,
and placing the black tin cylinder represented in the drawing by
dotted marks, over the lamp, they may be shewn in that manner
to several persons; thus, this instrument in a great degree supersedes
the use of a lanthorn. The image may be contracted occasionally
by one of the large lenses.</p>

<p>The following improvement consists in the manner of applying
the lamp, by Mr. Hill. By attaching it to the instrument, it
renders the light more permanent and steady, and reduces considerably
the bulk as well as the trouble of this appendage, and
is to be preferred when the lamp is not wanted separately for
other uses or experiments.</p>

<p>H, a brass support to the arm, G, for sustaining the weight of
the lamp; it turns round with the bar on the pillar, M. At
about I is a brass cap soldered to the above support, and which
slips over the slider carrying the larger lens, 2. At K, is a strong
joint connected with the said cap, and by which an horizontal
motion of the cap is given, when an oblique light is required.
To the end of this the lamp is fixed, and in such a manner as to
admit of its being easily slid upwards or downwards in a perpendicular
direction, to procure the just height of the flame. L is a
square brass rod to be occasionally screwed into the reservoir of
the lamp, for supporting the tin cylinder screen, when transparent
objects are to be represented on a screen in a darkened
room.</p>

<p>The transparent microscope, part of the lucernal, is sometimes
adapted to a large japanned tin lanthorn, such as represented at
Fig. 6. A brass female screw is soldered to the front of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page88">[88]</span>
lanthorn, which has a motion upwards or downwards, fitted to
the male screw of the transparent microscope. A tall chimney
is placed at the top of the lanthorn to conduct the heated air
from an Argand&#8217;s lamp withinside. The transparent objects in the
sliders are magnified by the lenses screwed on at <i>a</i>, and shewn
on the screen A; this screen may be about three feet square, of
white paper, the objects on which, if represented in a field larger
than twelve or eighteen inches, will not be sufficiently vivid.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones has found that a large square glass, from twelve to
sixteen inches in the side, rough ground on one of its surfaces,
exhibits the objects the best of any other contrivance; answers
tolerably well for opake objects, and gives the artist the means
of tracing their figure most correctly on its surface. Such sort of
objects he fixes upon slips of glass for that purpose, or applies
them to a pair of nippers shewn at <i>b</i>, sent with the microscope.
A concave silver speculum screws on at <i>c</i>, before the magnifiers,
which reflects upon the objects the light that issues from the lamp
through the body of the microscope. The least dimensions of the
lanthorn are about ten inches square, and fourteen inches high.</p>

<p>This microscope and lanthorn, when made as a separate apparatus
from the lucernal, is called the <span class="smcapall">LANTHORN MICROSCOPE</span>.
Its effect is considerably short of what is produced by the solar
microscope, and not equal to what is much wished for in this
manner of magnifying minute objects; see <a href="#Footnote30">note</a>, <a href="#Page77">page 77</a>.</p>

<p>Partly from the improvements just described, Mr. Jones is now
constructing a lucernal microscope that he conceives will be the
most simple and perfect yet made. It could not be completed in
time to be described in this work; but its improvement and advantages
will be quite evident to any reader who has attended to the
description which I have just given.</p>

The compound or double microscope is in more general use than any other sort. Besides
its being less expensive than the lucernal or complete solar, it is found commodious and portable
in the observer&#8217;s apartment, when only a confined degree of microscopical pursuit is intended,
and that chiefly for a few hours amusement; it may be used both by day and night. In the
most improved of this kind the objects appear magnified in a field of view from about 12 to 15
inches in diameter. It is better adapted to transparent than to opake objects, yet the latter
may often be viewed to great advantage by the assistance of the sun&#8217;s rays or the light of a
candle condensed on them. The intelligent reader, by attending to the accounts of the different
microscopes described in this work, will be enabled to select that best adapted to the kind of
objects he wishes to explore, and the manner in which he is desirous of having them exhibited.

<h3>THE DESCRIPTION AND USE OF JONES&#8217;S IMPROVED COMPOUND
OR DOUBLE MICROSCOPES, REPRESENTED IN Fig. 1 AND 2.
<a href="#Plate4">Plate IV.</a> BY THE EDITOR.</h3>

<p>The chief imperfections of Cuff&#8217;s microscope, as well as of
others formerly made, are, their construction rendering them only
compound microscopes, the body of the instrument having but
a fixed position over the object, and the smallness of the field
of view by the old construction of the glasses in the body. To
obviate these defects, as well as for the application of material
improvements, the late Messrs. Martin and Adams, and the present
Messrs. W. and S. Jones, have constructed this kind of microscope
in various ways. Two microscopes by the latter artists,
which I am now going to describe, appear to me to be the best
of any hitherto invented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page93">[93]</span></p>

<p>Fig. 1 is a representation of the second best sort of compound
microscopes. The improvements, though few in number, are
essential to the use thereof. The field of view is considerably
larger than in the former microscope. The stage and the mirrors
are both moveable, so that their respective distances may be easily
varied. The magnifiers may be moved about over the object.
There is also a condensing glass, for increasing the density of the
light, when it is reflected by the mirror from a candle or lamp.
It is furnished with two mirrors, one plane and the other concave,
and may likewise be used as a complete single microscope.</p>

<p>A B, Fig. 1. represents the body of the microscope, containing
a double eye glass, and a body glass; it is here shewn
as screwed to the arm C D, from whence it may be occasionally
removed, either for the convenience of packing, or when the instrument
is to be used as a single microscope.</p>

<p>The eye glasses and the body glasses are contained in a tube
which fits into the exterior tube A B; by pulling out a little this
tube, when the microscope is in use, the magnifying power of
each lens is increased.</p>

<p>The body A B of the microscope is supported by the arm C D;
this arm is moveable in a square socket cut in the head that is
connected to the main pillar E F, which is screwed firmly to the
mahogany pedestal G H; there is a drawer to this pedestal,
which holds the apparatus. This arm may be slid backwards
and forwards in its socket, carrying the magnifiers and the body
of glasses, and also turned horizontally quite round upon the
pillar, giving a general motion all over the object on the stage
below; which is a material improvement and advantage of this
microscope over a similar one described in the former edition of<span class="pagenum" id="Page94">[94]</span>
this work, as any unavoidable motion of the living object to be
viewed may be followed, by the observer&#8217;s hand moving the
arm C D as the object changes its place.</p>

<p>N I S is the plate or stage which carries the slider-holder K,
this stage is moved up or down the pillar E F, by turning the
milled nut M; this nut is fixed to a pinion, that works in a toothed
rack cut on one side of the pillar. By means of this pinion the
stage may be gradually raised or depressed, and the object adjusted
to the focus of the different lenses.</p>

<p>K is the slider-holder, which fits into a hole that is in the
middle of the stage N I S; it is used to confine and guide either
the motion of the sliders which contain the objects, or the glass
tubes that are designed to confine small fishes, for viewing the
circulation of the blood. The sliders and tubes are to be passed
between the two upper plates.</p>

<p>L is a brass tube, in the upper part of which is fixed the condensing
lens before spoken of; it screws into the wire arm a,
which is placed in the hole I of the stage, with the glass underneath,
and may be set at different distances from the object, according
to its distance from the mirror or the candle.</p>

<p>O is the frame which holds the two reflecting mirrors, one of
which is plane, the other concave. These mirrors may be moved
in various directions, in order to reflect the light properly, by
means of the pivots on which they move, in the semicircle Q,
and the motion of the semicircle itself on the pin R; the concave
mirror generally answers best in the day-time; the plane mirror
combines better with the condensing lens in L, and a lamp or
candle at night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page95">[95]</span></p>

<p>At S is a hole and slit for receiving either the nippers <i>b</i>, or
the fish-pan <i>c</i>; when these are used, the slider-holder K must be
removed.</p>

<p>T, a hole to receive the pin of the convex lens and illuminator
<i>d</i>.</p>

<p>There are six magnifying lenses contained in a brass wheel
screwed in a circular brass box P; this wheel is moveable about
its center with the finger, and stops by a click when the magnifiers
are each centrally under the body A B above, or the hole in
the arm C D. They are marked from No. 1, to 6, and the proper
number shewn in a small opening made in the side of the brass
box. This wheel P screws into the arm C D, and may occasionally
be taken off to admit of the silver speculum, or a single
magnifier, hereafter to be described.</p>

<p>There is a small line cut on the edge of the arm C D, which
must be brought to the right hand edge of its socket, in order to
center the magnifier to the body and the stage.</p>

<p>By unscrewing the body A B, the single magnifiers in the
wheel P being then only left, the instrument readily forms a single
microscope.</p>

<p>A small pocket hand single or opake microscope may easily be
extracted from this apparatus. When the body A B is screwed
off, and the arm C D slipt away from its frame with the wheel of
magnifiers, and the forceps, wire, and joint <i>b</i> applied to it, by a
hole made in the arm for that purpose, as represented at V, it is
then ready for the examination of any small object that may present
itself in the garden, &amp;c. and will be found very convenient
whenever the whole instrument is not required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page96">[96]</span></p>

<h4>LIST OF APPARATUS GENERALLY MADE TO THIS MICROSCOPE.</h4>

<p>The wheel, with the magnifiers, P. Fig. 1.</p>

<p>The body of the microscope, A B.</p>

<p>The slider-holder, K.</p>

<p>The tube, with the condensing lens L, to be used by candle-light.</p>

<p>The pin and arm <i>a</i>, either for the above lens, or for the silver
concave speculum <i>e</i>.</p>

<p>The silver concave speculum <i>e</i>, fitted to the arm above, and
used common to all the magnifiers in the wheel and body A B, it
is to reflect the light from the concave or plane mirror O below,
upon the opake objects, then called the compound opake microscope.</p>

<p>A silver concave speculum <i>f</i>, with a single magnifier; it screws
to the under part of the arm C D in room of the wheel of magnifiers,
and forms then the single opake microscope.</p>

<p>A brass cone <i>g</i>, to place under the stage N I S, and serves to
diminish the reflected light when necessary.</p>

<p>The jointed nippers <i>b</i>, fitted to the stage, to hold any small insect,
or other opake object.</p>

<p>A cylinder of ivory <i>h</i>, to fix on the pointed end of the nippers,
black on one side and white on the other, to make a contrast to
the opake object used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page97">[97]</span></p>

<p>Six ivory sliders, <i>i</i>, each having four holes, and objects contained
between two talcs confined together by brass circular
wires. One of the sliders is usually sent without objects, to be
supplied at pleasure. When used, they are placed between the
perforated plates of the slider-holder K; where also is to be
applied the brass frame slider <i>k</i>, containing in one brass piece
four small concave glasses fixed; a narrow slip of glass slides
over these, all within the frame; so that any very small living
object, as a mite, &amp;c., may be viewed with the proper security.</p>

<p>A set of glass tubes, <i>l</i>, three in number, to contain tadpoles,
water newts, small frogs, eels, &amp;c. which are curious objects for
affording a fine view of the circulation of the blood, &amp;c. They
are also to be placed in the slider-holder K. There is a small
hole at one end to admit air, the other end is to be stopped with
cork, to contain the fluid and prevent the escape of the animal.
A brass twisted wire is sent, to assist in the cleaning of these
tubes.</p>

<p>A small ivory box, <i>m</i>, containing talcs and wires to supply the
ivory sliders with, should any be lost or damaged.</p>

<p>A lens set in a brass cell, <i>n</i>, of such a focus as to view objects
under a magnifying power sufficient for the applying them to the
instrument for further inspection; hence it has been called the
explorator. It may occasionally be screwed to the arm C D,
and is then well adapted for viewing objects of the larger kind,
or the whole of an insect, &amp;c. before the observing of it in part
under the regular magnifiers.</p>

<p>A concave, or a circular plane glass, <i>o</i>, for transparent objects,
or animalcula in fluids, &amp;c. it is fitted to the side, I, of the
stage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page98">[98]</span></p>

<p>It is necessary to describe the lens and frame, <i>d</i>, noticed at
<a href="#Page95">page 95</a>; it is either for converging the sun&#8217;s rays upon opake
objects laid upon the stage, or for magnifying a flower, or other
large objects applied to the stage, or on the nippers or point, <i>b</i>.
By its pin and spring socket it is easily raised to any height, for
the sun, candle, or the eye of the observer.</p>

<p>A brass insect box, <i>h</i>, consisting of a concave and plane glass
that screw close together; by means of which a louse, flea, &amp;c.
may be secured, viewed alive, and retained for any time. It is
applied to the hole I, of the stage, Fig. 1.</p>

<p>A pair of small brass forceps, <i>q</i>, by which any small object
may be conveniently taken up or moved.</p>

<p>This microscope packs into a mahogany pyramidical shaped
case, about seven inches square at its base, and fourteen inches
in height. For its price, see the general <a href="#PageA1">list</a> annexed to this work.</p>

<h4>TO USE THIS MICROSCOPE.</h4>

<p>It will be obvious to the reader from the preceding description
that it must be put together as represented in the figure; that
he has to place the slider-holder, K, to the stage, N I S, with
one slider of objects; to reflect as strong a light as possible from
the concave mirror, O, below, by turning it into the best position,
and moving it upwards or downwards all the while he is looking
down the body, A B. Then, for a distinct view of the object, to
turn the pinion, M, in a slow and gentle manner. A small degree
of practice will render the management very familiar.</p>

<p>For opake objects, the slider-holder, K, is to be removed; the
silver speculum, <i>e</i>, screwed to the arm, <i>a</i>, and by its pin placed<span class="pagenum" id="Page99">[99]</span>
in the hole, I, of the stage, with the concave part downward
above the stage; the glass, <i>o</i>, or the nippers, <i>b</i>, with ivory, <i>h</i>,
placed at the stage: then the light reflected from the mirror, O,
up to the speculum above, which will again reflect the light very
strongly upon the object. Practice also in this case can make it
easy to the beginner. The use of the rest of the apparatus has
been sufficiently explained.</p>

<h3>OF THE MOST IMPROVED COMPOUND MICROSCOPE, BEING UNIVERSAL
IN ITS USES, AND FORMING THE SINGLE, COMPOUND,
OPAKE, AND AQUATIC MICROSCOPES.</h3>

<p>A person much accustomed to observations by the microscope,
will readily discern the several advantages of this instrument
over the preceding one. Besides its containing an additional
quantity of useful apparatus, it is more commodious and complete
for the management while observing, as it may instantly be
placed in a vertical, oblique, or horizontal situation, turned laterally
at the ease of the observer, and the objects viewed by the
primary direct light, or reflected as usual, at pleasure. These
particulars the following description will clearly shew. I shall not
again so fully describe the same apparatus, as the reader must already
understand their uses from the preceding references.</p>

<p>Fig. 2 is a representation of this instrument as placed up for
use. A B is the compound body. The eye-glasses are contained
in an inner tube that slides outwards or inwards, thus altering its
distance from a glass at B, and thereby increasing or diminishing
the magnifying power, when thought necessary. This body may
be screwed on or off to the arm C D, as in the microscope just described;
the arm C D may also be moved in any direction over
the object. E F is the square stem or bar, on which is moved by<span class="pagenum" id="Page100">[100]</span>
the rack-work and pinion M, the stage N I S, to adjust a distinct
view to any of the magnifiers, or apparatus used. V is a strong
brass pillar with a joint-piece at top, connected to the stem E F;
by means of this joint the position of the microscope is readily
altered from a vertical to an oblique or horizontal one, as may be
desired or found most easy and convenient to the observer, while
sitting or standing; it will also enable him to view objects by direct
unreflected light; for, when the stem, E F, is put into an horizontal
position, the mirrors, O, R, may be drawn off and laid aside.
Against or before the condensing lens, U, the common day-light
or the light of a candle may then be directed.</p>

<p>At the stage N I S, is a sliding brass spring, N, serving to confine
down slips of glass or large sliders, when objects placed
thereon are intended to be viewed out of the horizontal position
of the stage. A lens, U, called the condensing lens, fixed in
a frame connected to a socket, is for condensing and modifying
the rays of light reflected from the concave or plane mirror, O,
below; it may be set to a proper distance by raising it up by
two little screws, one of which is shewn at <i>u</i>. This lens is of
considerable use by candle-light, as it serves to fill the whole
body, A B, beautifully with light on the object. It is turned
aside on a joint pin, when not in use. Six magnifiers are
contained in the wheel at P, as in the former microscope. The
mirrors, O, below may also be slid upwards or downwards on the
stem, by pushing against the screws at <i>r</i>. Thus the stage, lens U,
and mirrors below, being all in one axis of motion, admit the adjustment
of the distinct view, light, &amp;c. in the most accurate and
pleasing manner. When the instrument is packed into its case,
the feet, G G H, may all be folded together as one, and the body
A B, screwed off, for the advantage of being portable. The body,
as screwed off, leaves the instrument a single microscope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page101">[101]</span></p>

<h4>THE GENERAL APPARATUS TO THIS MICROSCOPE IS
AS FOLLOWS.</h4>

<p>First, such as accompany the preceding microscope. The brass
wheel with magnifiers, P, Fig. 2. The slider-holder, K. The
brass pin and arm, <i>a</i>, for receiving the concave speculum, <i>e</i>,
which is applied to the upper side of the stage, and used common
to all the magnifiers. The silver concave speculum, <i>f</i>, with a
magnifier set therein, used by itself in the arm C D. These two
speculums form the instrument into what is called an <span class="smcapall">OPAKE
MICROSCOPE</span>.</p>

<p>A brass cone, g, fitting the under side of the stage, N I S, to
exclude superfluous light. The illuminator, or convex lens, <i>d</i>,
Fig. 1, fitted to T of the stage. The jointed nippers, <i>b</i>, fitted to
the stage, and either on the point or nippers to hold any small insect,
or other opake object. An ivory black and white piece, <i>h</i>,
is also fitted to the point to contrast the colour of any object laid
thereon; the light upon this is reflected from the silver concaves
placed above, which reflect the light downwards received from
the mirrors at O. Six ivory sliders as shewn at <i>i</i>, containing a
selection of objects, placed between Muscovy talc, and fastened
by spring wires; and a brass frame slider, <i>k</i>: all for the stage, K,
when in use. A set of glass tubes for fish or liquids, <i>l</i>, to be filled
with water and stopped with cork, for the slider-holder K. A
pan, <i>c</i>, for fish or frogs, fitted to the stage at S. A small
ivory box, <i>m</i>, with spare talcs and wires. The explorator, <i>n</i>, a
lens set in a brass cell, for viewing the larger sort of objects either
by the hand, or from the arm C D, Fig. 2. A plane glass, <i>o</i>, and
a concave ditto, <i>s</i>, both fitted to the hole of the stage, N I S, for
viewing fluids, and confining the animalcula, &amp;c. between them,
and so forming what is called the <span class="smcapall">AQUATIC MICROSCOPE</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page102">[102]</span></p>

<p>A brass box, <i>p</i>, with a concave and plane glass, for insects and
other objects, fitted to the stage N I S, when they are to be examined
by the instrument. A pair of brass forceps, <i>q</i>, to take or
hold any object by. A camel hair brush, <i>t</i>.</p>

<h4>ADDITIONAL APPARATUS TO THIS BEST MICROSCOPE.</h4>

<p>Three large wood sliders, as shewn at X, with talcs and wires,
for the larger sort of wings of flies, and other objects which are
too large for the small ivory sliders, <i>i</i>; they are to be placed in
the slider-holder K, when on the stage N I S, and the objects to
be magnified either by the magnifiers in the wheel P, or the lens
shewn at <i>n</i>, screwed on the arm C D. A brass cell, <i>y</i>, with a
very small globule or lens, or an extraordinary great magnifier,
usually about the 30th or 40th of an inch focus; it is to be
screwed into the arm C D, when the wheel, P, is first unscrewed
away. It is for the purpose of viewing extreme minute objects,
which may be so small as to elude the power of the magnifiers in
the wheel, P.</p>

<p>A moveable stage, W, which by the pin, <i>a</i>, is applied to the
hole, S, of the stage Fig. 2, and thereby has an horizontal motion
under the whole field of view, without disturbing any other part
of the instrument. To the large hole of this stage are fitted a
deep concave glass, <i>r</i>, and the concave and plane glasses, <i>s</i> and <i>o</i>;
and to the small holes, <i>x</i> <i>x</i>, a black and white piece of ivory, <i>w</i>,
for opake objects, and a concave and plane glass similar to <i>o</i> and <i>s</i>.
An extra concave silver speculum with a less magnifier than the
other, as shewn at <i>f</i>, used for the larger kind of opake objects,
like the other, fitted to the arm C D, and used instead of the magnifiers
in the wheel, P.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page103">[103]</span></p>

<p>Rack-work is sometimes cut in the arm C D, to turn the pinion
above, so as to move the magnifiers in a linear direction over the
objects in the most accurate degree; and also the stage N I S
jointed, to turn by a screw and teeth in an horizontal direction at
right angles to the above, thereby rendering a slow and accurate
motion, perfectly suitable to the various positions of any living
animal under examination.</p>

<p>Six or more larger ivory sliders, with cuttings of different
woods, &amp;c. are also frequently added; but as these enhance the
expense, and may be extended to the desire of the purchaser,
his choice, and not my description here, will determine the
extent of the apparatus to the microscope. When packed up
into its mahogany, or black shagreen case, the outside dimensions
are about twelve inches and an half long, nine inches broad, and
three inches three-quarters deep.</p>

<p>A microscope from this plan is frequently made of smaller dimensions,
for the convenience of persons who frequently travel,
and is contained in a fish-skin case about seven inches long, four
inches and an half broad, and two inches deep, and is the most
complete instrument of the sort.</p>

<h4>TO USE THIS MICROSCOPE.</h4>

<p>As in the former one, place the slider-holder K, with a slider
of objects in it, in the stage N I S; move the arm C D, in its
socket, so that a mark on the side is brought to the edge of the
socket; then turn the arm till the magnifier is directly central
over the object; look down the tube A B, and during that time,
reflect the light strongly and clearly up into it from the mirror O
below; and then, while you are looking through the body,
gently turn the pinion at M to the right or left, till you see the
object magnified in the most distinct and well-defined manner.<span class="pagenum" id="Page104">[104]</span>
Attending properly to this mode is the only care necessary to use
any microscope whatsoever; and for want of doing which, many
a beginner finds a difficulty in using properly his instrument.
For price, see the <a href="#PageA1">list</a> at the end.</p>

<p>For opake objects, you take away the slider-holder, K; place
on the stage either the concave glass, <i>s</i>, or the nippers, <i>b</i>; screw
the concave speculum, <i>e</i>, to the arm, <i>a</i>, which place on the stage
with the arm in the hole, I. The light is now to be reflected
into this concave dish from one of the mirrors, O, below, and it
will thus be strongly condensed upon the object. With this concave
speculum any of the magnifiers in the wheel, P, may be
used. When the single silver concave, <i>f</i>, is used, it is screwed
to the arm C D, and the one, <i>e</i>, and arm, <i>a</i>, are not then applied.</p>

<p>For further directions for the management of microscopes, the

<h3>A DESCRIPTION OF CULPEPER&#8217;S, OR THE COMMON THREE-PILLARED
MICROSCOPE. <a href="#Plate4">Plate IV.</a> Fig. 3.</h3>

<p>The only recommendations of this original instrument are, its
simple construction and lowness of price. It gives a pleasing view
of the object. It is precluded by its form from some of the advantages
of the two foregoing instruments, because both the
stage and the mirror are confined. This microscope consists of a
large exterior brass body, A B, supported on three brass scrolls,
which are fixed to the stage F; the stage is supported by three
larger scrolls that are screwed to the mahogany pedestal G H.
There is a drawer in the pedestal which holds the apparatus.
The concave mirror, I, is fitted to a socket in the center of the
pedestal. The lower part, B, of the body forms an exterior tube,<span class="pagenum" id="Page105">[105]</span>
into which the upper part of the body, C, slides, and may be
moved up or down by the hand, so as to bring the magnifiers
which are screwed on at D, nearer to, or further from the object.</p>

<h4>A LIST OF THE APPARATUS TO CULPEPER&#8217;S MICROSCOPE.</h4>

<p>Five magnifiers, each fitted in a brass cell; one of these is
seen screwed on at D. Six ivory sliders, <i>k</i>, five of them with objects;
and a small ivory box, <i>m</i>, containing some spare talcs, and
wires for them. A brass tube, N, to hold the concave speculum.
A brass box, M, for the same speculum. A fish-pan, <i>c</i>. A set
of glass tubes, <i>b</i>. A flat and a concave glass, both fitted to the
stage. A brass cone, <i>g</i>, to exclude superfluous light; it applies
at the under side of the stage, F. A brass box, <i>p</i>, with plane and
concave glasses for living objects. A pair of forceps, <i>q</i>. A steel
wire, <i>b</i>, with a pair of nippers at one end, a point at the other,
and a small ivory cylinder, <i>h</i>, to fit on the pointed end of the
nippers. A convex lens, E, moveable in a brass semicircle; this
is affixed to a long brass pin, which fits into a hole, F, on the
stage. The uses of the above apparatus have been sufficiently described
in the preceding pages.</p>

<h4>TO USE THIS MICROSCOPE.</h4>

<p>Screw one of the five cells, which contains a magnifying lens,
to the end, D, of the body; place the slider <i>i</i> or <i>k</i>, with the objects,
between the plates of the slider-holder, K. Then, to attain distinct
vision and a pleasing view of the object, adjust the sliding
body to the focus of the lens you are using, by moving the upper
part, C, gently up and down while you are looking at the
object, and regulate the light by the concave mirror, I, below.
The image of the objects in this microscope is seen in a field of
view of about six inches in diameter; but, in the improved ones
before described, it is from about twelve to fifteen inches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page106">[106]</span></p>

<p>For opake objects, two additional pieces must be used; the
first is a cylindrical tube of brass, represented at N, which fits on
the cylindrical snout above D of the body: the second piece is
the concave speculum, L; this is to be screwed to the lower end
of the aforesaid tube. The upper edge of this tube should be
made to coincide with the line which has the same number affixed
to it as the magnifier you are using; that is, if you are making
use of the magnifier marked 5, slide the tube to the circular
line on the tube above D, that is marked also with No. 5.</p>

<p>The slider-holder, K, should be removed when you are going
to view opake objects, and a plane glass should be placed on the
stage in its stead to receive the object; or it may be placed on the
nippers, <i>b</i>, the pin of which fits into the hole in the stage.</p>

<h3>A DESCRIPTION OF MARTIN&#8217;S IMPROVED SOLAR MICROSCOPE,
WHICH IS CONSTRUCTED TO EXHIBIT TRANSPARENT AND
OPAKE OBJECTS. <a href="#Plate5">Plate V.</a></h3>

<p>The solar microscope is generally supposed to afford the most
entertainment, on account of the wonderful extent of its magnifying
power, and the ease with which several persons may view
each single object at the same time. The use of it was, however,
confined for many years only to transparent objects. About the
year 1774, Mr. B. Martin so far improved this instrument, as to
render it applicable to opake, as well as to transparent objects,
exhibiting the magnified image of either kind on a large screen.
Treating of it himself, he says<a href="#Footnote34" id="FNanchor34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>, &#8220;With this instrument all opake
objects, whether of the animal, vegetable, or mineral kingdom,
may be exhibited in great perfection, in all their native beauty;
the lights and shades, the prominences and cavities, and all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page107">[107]</span>
varieties of different hues, teints, and colours, heightened by the
reflection of the solar rays condensed upon them.&#8221; From its
enlarged dimensions, transparent objects are also shewn with
greater perfection than in the common solar microscope.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote34"><a href="#FNanchor34" class="label">[34]</a> Description and Use of an Opake Solar Microscope. 8vo. 1774.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p><a href="#Plate5">Plate V.</a> Fig. 1, represents the solar opake microscope, placed
together for exhibiting opake objects.</p>

<p>Fig. 2, is that part called the single tooth and pinion microscope,
which is used for shewing transparent objects; the cylindrical
tube, Y, thereof, being made to fit into the tube E F, Fig. 1.
It may be occasionally used as a hand single, or Wilson&#8217;s microscope,
and for which purpose, the handle, <i>c</i>, is fitted by a
screw to the body at <i>g</i>, and the tube, Y, screwed away.</p>

<p>Fig. 3, the slider which contains the six magnifiers; it fits into
a dove-tail under P, Fig. 2, at the upper part of the microscope.</p>

<p>Fig. 4 represents a brass dove-tail slider, containing a small
lens: it is called a condenser. There are three in number,
marked 1 and 2, &amp;c. corresponding to the number of the magnifiers
used: they serve to condense the sun&#8217;s rays strongly upon
the object, and enlarge the circle of light. They slide in at <i>h</i>,
Fig. 2.</p>

<p>A B C D E F, Fig. 1, represents the body of the solar microscope;
one part thereof, A B C D, is conical, the other, C D E F,
is cylindrical. The cylindrical part receives the tube, G, of the
opake object box, or the tube, Y, of the single microscope,
Fig. 2. At the large end, A B, of the conical part there is a convex
lens to receive the rays from the mirror, and refract them
convergingly into the box, H I K L.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page108">[108]</span></p>

<p>N O P is a brass frame which is fixed to the moveable circular
plate, <i>a b c</i>; in this frame there is a plane mirror, to reflect the
solar rays through the afore-mentioned lens. This mirror may
be moved into the proper positions for reflecting the solar rays,
by means of rack-work turned by the nuts Q and R. By the nut
Q, it may be moved from right to left; it maybe elevated or depressed
by the nut, R. <i>d</i> <i>e</i>, two screws to fasten the microscope to
a window-shutter, or a board fitted entirely before the window.</p>

<p>The box for opake objects is represented as open at H I K L;
it contains a plane mirror, M, for reflecting the light that it receives
from the large lens to the object, and thereby illuminating
it; S is a screw to adjust this mirror to its proper angle for reflecting
the light. V X, two tubes of brass, one sliding within
the other, the exterior one in the box, H I K L; these carry two
magnifying lenses: the interior tube is sometimes taken out, and
the exterior one is then used by itself. Part of this tube may be
seen in the plate as within the box, H I K L.</p>

<p>At H, is a brass plate, the back part of which is fixed to a
tube, <i>h</i>, containing a spiral wire, which keeps the plate always
bearing against the side, H, of the brass box H I K L. The sliders,
with the opake objects, Fig. 5, pass between this plate and
the side of the box; to apply which, the plate is to be drawn back
by means of the nut, g. <i>k i</i>, a door to one side of the opake box,
to be opened when adjusting the mirror, M.</p>

<p>The foregoing pieces constitute the several parts necessary for
viewing opake objects. We shall now proceed to describe the
single microscope, which is used for transparent objects; but, in
order to examine these, the box, H I K L, must be first removed,
and in its place we must insert the tube, Y, of the single microscope,
Fig. 2, now to be explained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page109">[109]</span></p>

<p>Fig. 2 represents a large tooth and pinion microscope; at <i>m</i>,
within the body of this microscope, are two thin plates that are
to be separated, in order to let the ivory sliders, Fig. 7, pass between
them; they are pressed together by a spiral spring, which
bears up the under plate, and forces it against the upper one. The
slider, Fig. 3, that contains the magnifiers, fits into a hole at <i>n</i>;
any of the magnifiers may be placed before the object, by moving
the aforesaid slider: when the magnifier is at the center of the
hole P, a small spring falls into one of the notches which is on
the side of the slider, Fig. 3. At <i>h</i>, slides a condenser, Fig. 4,
for condensing the sun&#8217;s rays, and enlarging the field of view on
the screen: the number must correspond with that of the magnifier
used. This microscope is adjusted to the focus, while exhibiting
the object, by turning the milled nut O.</p>

<h4>APPARATUS TO THE OPAKE SOLAR MICROSCOPE.</h4>

<p>The mirror O P, Fig. 1, and square plate, and the tubular body
of the microscope, A F. The opake box and its tube, I K G.
The tooth and pinion or single microscope, Fig. 2. The slider of
magnifiers, Fig. 3. The megalascope magnifier, Fig. 6, fitted to P
of Fig. 2. Six ivory sliders with transparent objects, Fig. 7.
Twelve wood sliders with opake objects, and a brass frame to
hold them, Fig. 5. A brass square-formed slider case, Fig. 8, to
hold any animal, piece of ore, or other opake object, and is to be
placed like the other slider at H, Fig. 1. A pair of nippers and
point, Fig. 9, the pin, <i>a</i>, of which fits into the hole of the slider,
Fig. 4, and holds before the magnifiers at P, Fig. 2, any small fly
or other complete object to be magnified. A four-glass slider in
a brass frame, Fig. 10, for any animalcula, &amp;c. to be placed between
the plates at <i>m</i>, Fig. 2. A set of glass fish tubes, Fig. 11. A
pair of forceps, Fig. 12. Two brass nuts for the window-shutter<span class="pagenum" id="Page110">[110]</span>
or board, Fig. 13; and the two brass fastening screws, <i>d e</i>, Fig. 1,
which may be either used with or without the above two nuts.</p>

<p>The figures on the <a href="#Plate5">plate</a> are about half the original size, and
the apparatus now made by Messrs. Jones packs into a case thirteen
inches long, nine inches broad, and four inches deep. For
price, see the <a href="#PageA1">list</a> at the end.</p>

<h4>TO USE THE SOLAR MICROSCOPE.</h4>

<p>Make a round hole in a window-shutter or window-board,
that is opposite to the meridian sun, or as nearly so as possible, a
little larger than the circle <i>a b c</i>; pass the mirror, N O P, through
this hole, and apply the square plate to the shutter; then mark
with a pencil the places which correspond to the two holes
through which the screws are to pass; take away the microscope,
and bore two holes at the marked places, large enough to admit
the milled screws, <i>d e</i>, to pass through them. These screws are
to pass from the outside of the shutter, to go through it, and
being then screwed into their respective holes in the square plate,
they will, when screwed home, hold it fast against the inside of
the shutter, and thus support the microscope.</p>

<p>Another way, and perhaps more convenient, is to previously
screw the two brass nuts, Fig. 13, to the shutter or window-board,
at the inside at a suitable distance, to receive the two milled
screws; these nuts will always be ready for use, and the operator
may in a minute, within his room, fasten the plate, <i>a b c</i>, to the
shutter by the two milled screws, being placed contrarywise.</p>

<p>Screw the conical tube, A B C D, to the circle, <i>a b c</i>, and then
slide the tube, G, of the opake box into the cylindrical part,<span class="pagenum" id="Page111">[111]</span>
C D E F, of the body, if opake objects are to be examined; but if
transparent objects are intended to be shewn, then place the
tube Y, Fig. 2, within the tube C D E F. The room is to be darkened
as much as possible, that no light may enter but what
passes through the body of the microscope; for, on this circumstance,
together with the brightness of the sun, the perfection
and distinctness of the image in a great measure depend.</p>

<p>We shall first consider the microscope as going <span class="smcapall">TO BE USED
FOR OPAKE OBJECTS</span>. Adjust the mirror, N O P, so as to receive
the solar rays, by means of the two finger-screws or nuts,
Q, R; the first, Q, turns the mirror to the right or left; the second,
R, raises or depresses it: this you are to do, till you have
reflected the sun&#8217;s light through the lens at A B, strongly upon a
white-paper screen or cloth, from four to eight feet square (about
the latter dimensions for transparent objects) placed from about
five to eight feet distance from the window, and formed thereon
a round spot of light: a white wainscot or wall at a suitable distance
answers very well. An unexperienced observer will find it
more convenient to obtain the light by first forming this spot,
before he puts on either the opake box, or the tooth and pinion
microscope, Fig. 2.</p>

<p>Now apply the opake box, and place the object between the
plates at H; open the door, <i>k i</i>, and adjust the mirror, M, till you
see you have illuminated the object strongly. If you cannot
effect this by the screw S, you must move the screws Q, R, in
order to get the light reflected strongly from the mirror, N O P,
on the mirror M; without which the latter cannot illuminate the
object. The object being strongly illuminated, shut the door, <i>k i</i>,
and a distinct view of the object will soon be obtained on your
screen, by adjusting the tubes V X, with the magnifiers, which is
effected by moving them backwards or forwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page112">[112]</span></p>

<p>A perfectly round spot of light cannot always be procured in
northern latitudes, the altitude of the sun being often too low;
neither can it be obtained when the sun is directly perpendicular
to the front of the room. As the sun is continually changing its
place, it will be necessary, in order to keep his rays full upon the
object, to keep them continually directed through the axis of the
instrument, by turning the two screws Q and R.</p>

<p>To view transparent objects, remove the opake box, and insert
the tube, Y, of Fig. 2, in its place; put the slider, Fig. 3, into its
place at <i>n</i>, a condenser, Fig. 4, at <i>h</i>, and the slider with the objects
between the plates at <i>m</i>; then adjust the mirror, N O P, as
before directed, by the screws, Q, R, so that the light may pass
through the object; regulate the focus of the magnifier by the
pinion, O. The most pleasing magnifiers in use are the fourth
and fifth. The size of the object is generally from four to eight
feet, and may be increased or diminished by altering the distance
of the screen from the microscope; five or six feet is a convenient
distance.</p>

<p>The effect by this sort of microscope is stupendous, and never
fails to excite wonder in an observer at the first view, in seeing a
flea, &amp;c. augmented in appearance to <span class="smcapall">SEVEN</span>, <span class="smcapall">EIGHT</span>, or even
<span class="smcapall">TEN FEET</span> in length, with all its colours, motions, and animal
functions, distinctly and beautifully exhibited.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To examine transparent objects of a larger size</span>, or
to render the instrument what is usually called a megalascope,
take out the slider, Fig. 3, from its place at <i>n</i>; screw the cell
and lens, Fig. 6, into the hole at P, Fig. 2; remove the glass
which is placed at <i>h</i>, and regulate the light and focus agreeable
to the foregoing directions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page113">[113]</span></p>

<p>At C D, is placed a lens for increasing the density of the
rays, for the purpose of burning or melting any fusible substance;
this lens must be removed in most cases, lest the objects should
be burnt. The intensity of the light is also varied by moving the
tube G, and Fig. 2, Y, inwards or outwards.</p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION OF THE TRANSPARENT SOLAR MICROSCOPE AND
APPARATUS. <a href="#Plate6">Plate VI.</a> Fig. 4, to 14.</h3>

<p>The foregoing description will, in great part, answer for this
microscope; but, the dimensions, apparatus, &amp;c. varying in a
small degree from the preceding, a distinct description here, may
be acceptable to those, who possess this sort of microscope only.</p>

<p>A B C D, Fig. 4, represents the body of the microscope, consisting
of two brass tubes. E F is the end of the inner moveable
tube; <i>e f</i>, that of the single tooth and pinion microscope. Fig. 5,
screws into the end of this inner tube; at the end, A B, of the external
tube there is a convex lens, to receive the sun&#8217;s rays from
the mirror, K L, and to condense them on the object; the end, A B,
screws into the circular plate, G H I. This part may also be used
as a single microscope, and may have at <i>m</i> the handle, <i>c</i>, screwed
to it. K L, a long frame fixed to the moveable circular plate, with
a plane mirror, to reflect the rays of the sun on the lens at A B.
An endless worm or screw, which is cut on the lower part of the
nut, M, works in a small wheel which is fixed to the frame, K L,
so that by turning the nut, the frame, K L, is moved up or down:
the nut, N, moves the mirror to the right or left. O, P, two
screws to fasten the square plate to the window-shutter.</p>

<p>Fig. 5, the single microscope; <i>e f</i>, the end which screws on to
the part, E F, Fig. 4, of the internal tube of the body; <i>q</i>, the dove-tailed
slit for receiving the slider, Fig. 8; <i>g</i>, the hole in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page114">[114]</span>
the megalascope magnifier, Fig. 6, is to be screwed, when the
slider, Fig. 8, is removed. At <i>h</i>, are the moveable plates, between
which the object sliders are placed; under the lowermost of
these, the lens represented at Fig. 11 is to be placed, when the
magnifiers in the slider, Fig. 8, are to be used, <i>a k</i> is a small
piece of rack-work, which is moved backwards and forwards by
the pinion fixed to the milled nut, <i>b</i>; by the gradual motion of
this rack, the objects are adjusted to the foci of the different lenses.
Fig. 8 is a brass slider, with six lenses, or magnifying glasses; it
is to be inserted into the hole at <i>q</i>; either of the magnifiers may
be placed before the object, by sliding it one way or the other:
you may perceive when the glass is in the center of the eye-hole
by a small spring acting upon a notch which is made on the side
of the slider opposite to each lens.</p>

<h4>APPARATUS BELONGING TO THIS SOLAR MICROSCOPE.</h4>

<p>Square plate and mirror. The body, A D, consisting of two
tubes, one within the other. The single microscope, Fig. 5. The
megalascope lens, Fig. 6. The slider, Fig. 8, with six lenses.
The two screws O, P. Six ivory sliders and a talc box, Fig. 7
and 13. Some glass tubes, Fig. 9. A slider or brass case, Fig. 10,
containing a plane piece of glass, and a brass slider with holes,
into which are cemented small concave glasses, designed for confining
minute insects between the plane and concave glasses, which
are thus preserved from being crushed, or from moving out of
the field of view. Three condensing lenses to enlarge the field of
view, such as Fig. 11, that are fitted to the hole, <i>l</i>, of Fig. 5.
Their numbers correspond with the numbers used. Fig. 12, two
brass nuts for the window-shutter or board, to receive the two
screws, O and P.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><span class="smcap">To use the transparent solar microscope.</span></h4>

<p class="hinline">Fasten the
square plate against the inside of a window-shutter, by the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page115">[115]</span>
screws O, P, which are to go from the outside of the window-shutter
through it, and then be screwed into their respective
holes in the square plate at G H I. The mirror is to be on the
outside of the shutter, passing through a hole made for that
purpose. Darken the room; then place a screen at about six or
eight feet distance from the window, the farther it is from it the
larger is the image: now move the mirror, K L, by the two nuts
M N, till the sun&#8217;s rays come through the instrument in an horizontal
direction to the screen, forming a round spot thereon;
screw the microscope, Fig. 5, into its place E F; put the slider
with the lenses, Fig. 8, at <i>q</i>, Fig. 5, and the object slider between
the plates at <i>h</i>; adjust the object to the focus of the magnifying
lens by the screw <i>b</i>, till the object appears distinct and clear on
the screen. By moving the internal tube of the body, the object
may be placed at different distances from the lens which is fixed
at A B, so as to be sufficiently illuminated, and not burnt by the
solar rays. If the screws O, P, are to pass inside the room, the
two nuts, Fig. 12, must be previously fixed.</p>

<h3>THE SCREW BARREL, OR WILSON&#8217;S SINGLE POCKET MICROSCOPE.
<a href="#Plate2B">Plate II. B.</a> Fig. 1 and 2.</h3>

<p>This microscope of Mr. Wilson&#8217;s is an invention of many years
standing, and was in some measure laid aside, till Dr. Lieberk&uuml;hn
introduced the solar apparatus to which he applied it, there being
no other instrument at that time which would answer his purpose
so well; it is much esteemed in particular cases. The body of
the microscope is represented at A B, Fig. 1, and is made either of
silver, brass, or ivory. C C is a long fine-threaded male screw, that
turns into the body of the microscope. D, a convex glass at the
end of the said screw, on which may be placed, as occasion requires,
one of the two concave apertures of thin brass to cover the
said glass, and thereby diminish the aperture when the greatest<span class="pagenum" id="Page116">[116]</span>
magnifiers are used. E, three thin plates of brass within the body
of the microscope, one whereof is bent to an arched cavity for the
reception of a tube of glass. F, a piece of wood or brass, curved
in the manner of the said plate, and fastened thereto. G, the other
end of the microscope, where a female screw is adapted to receive
the different magnifiers. H, a spiral spring of steel, between the
said end, G, and the plates of brass, E, intended to keep the plates
in a due position, and counteract against the long screw, C. I, a
small ivory handle. To this microscope belong seven different
magnifying glasses, six of which are set in cells, as in Fig. K, and
are marked from 1, to 6: the lowest numbers to the greatest
magnifiers. L is the seventh magnifier, set in the manner of a
little barrel, to be held in the hand for viewing any large object.
M is an ivory slider with the objects. Six of these, and one of
brass, are usually sold with this microscope. There is also a brass
slider not shewn in the figure, to confine any small object, that it
may be viewed without crashing or destroying it. N, a pair of
forceps, or pliers, for the taking up of insects or other objects, and
applying them to the sliders or glasses. O, a camel hair brush,
to take up and examine a small drop of liquid, brush the dust
away, &amp;c. P is a glass tube to confine living objects, such
as frogs, fishes, &amp;c.</p>

<p>When you view an object, push the ivory slider, in which the
said object is placed, between the two flat brass plates, observing
always to put that side of the slider, where the brass rings are,
farthest from the eye; then screw in the magnifying glass you intend
to use at the end of the instrument G, and looking through
it against the light, turn the long screw, C C, till your object is
brought to appear distinct, or to the true focal distance. To examine
any object accurately, view it first through a magnifier that
will shew the whole at once, and afterwards inspect the several
parts more particularly with one of the greatest magnifiers; for<span class="pagenum" id="Page117">[117]</span>
thus you will gain a true idea of the whole, and all its parts: and,
though the greatest magnifiers can shew but a minute portion of
any object at once, such as the claw of a flea, the horn of a louse,
&amp;c. yet by gently moving the slider that contains your object, the
eye will gradually see the whole; and if any part should be out
of the focal distance, the screw, C C, will easily bring it to the
true focus. As objects must be brought very near the glass, when
the greatest magnifiers are used, be particularly careful not to rub
the slider against the glasses as you move it in or out. A few
turns of the screw, C C, will easily obviate this.</p>

<h4>DESCRIPTION OF A SCROLL FOR FIXING WILSON&#8217;S POCKET MICROSCOPE,
AND A MIRROR FOR REFLECTING LIGHT INTO IT.</h4>

<p>A B C, Fig. 2, is a brass scroll, which, for the better conveniency
of carriage, is made to unscrew into three parts, and may
be put into the drawer upon which it stands, with its reflecting
mirror D, and Wilson&#8217;s pocket microscope, G. The upper part
of the scroll is taken off at B, by unscrewing half a turn of the
screw; then, if lifted up, it will come out of the socket. The
lower part unscrews at C, and the base at E. The mirror lifts
out at F, which, with the scroll, lies in one partition of the box.</p>

<p>To apply this scroll for use, fix the body of the microscope to
the top thereof by the screw, A, as in Fig. 2, by screwing it in
the same hole as the ivory handle was applied to before. The
brass or ivory slider being fixed as before described, and the microscope
placed in a perpendicular position, move the mirror, D,
in such a manner as to reflect the light of the sky, of the sun, or
a candle, directly upwards through the microscope; by which
means the object will be most conveniently viewed. It is further
useful for viewing opake objects, by screwing the arm, Q R, Fig. 1,
into the body of the microscope at G; then screwing into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page118">[118]</span>
round hole, R, that magnifier which you think will best suit your
object, and putting the concave speculum, S, on the outside of the
ring, R, you will observe in the body of the microscope, between
the wood or brass, F, and the end of the male screw, C C, a small
hole, <i>u</i>, through which slides the long wire, T, which has a point
at one end, and forceps at the other, that may be used occasionally
as your objects require. When you have fixed this, and your object
on it, turn the arm, R, till the magnifier is brought over the
object; it may be then adjusted to the true focus, by turning the
screw, as before. It must also be brought exactly over the speculum,
by turning the upper part of the scroll to one side, till
your object and the two specula are in one line, as will be
found by trial; and then fix it by the screw, B, at which time the
upper surface of the object will be enlightened by the light reflected
from the mirror, D, to the concave speculum.</p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION OF A SMALL MICROSCOPE FOR OPAKE OBJECTS.
<a href="#Plate2B">Plate II. B.</a> Fig. 3 and 4.</h3>

<p>A, Fig. 3, is a fixed arm, through which passes a screw, B, the
other end is fastened to the moveable arm, C. D, a nut fitted to
the said screw, which, when turned, will either separate or bring
together the two arms, A C. E, a steel spring, that separates the
two sides when the nut is unscrewed. F, a piece of brass turning
round in a spring socket, moving on a rivet, in which moves a steel
wire pointed at the end G, and the other end a pair of pliers, H:
these are either to thrust into, or take up and hold any object, and
may be turned round as required. I, a ring of brass, with a female
screw fixed on an upright piece of the same metal, turning on a rivet,
that it may be set at a due distance when the least magnifiers
are used, and is adapted to the screws of all the magnifiers.</p>

<p>Fig. 4, K, a concave speculum of polished silver, in the center
of which a lens is placed. On the back of this speculum a male<span class="pagenum" id="Page119">[119]</span>
screw, L, is made to fit the brass ring I, Fig. 3. Four of these
specula of different concavities, with four glasses of different magnifying
powers, as the objects may require. The greatest magnifiers
have the least apertures. M, a round object plate, one side
white and the other black, intended to render objects the more
visible, by placing them, if black, upon the white, and if white,
on the black side. A steel spring, N, turns down on each side,
to secure any object; from the object plate there is a hollow pipe,
to screw it on the needle&#8217;s point G, Fig. 3. O, a small box of
brass, with a glass on each side, to confine any living object in
order to examine it, having a pipe to screw upon the end of the
needle at G. P, an ivory handle. Q, a pair of pliers to take up
any object. R, a soft hair brush.</p>

<p>To view any object, screw the speculum, with the magnifier
you intend to use, into the brass ring, I; place your object either
on the needle G, in the pliers H, on the object plate M, or in the
brass hollow box O, as may be most convenient; then holding up
your instrument by the handle P, look against the light through
the magnifying lens, and by means of the nut, D, together with
moving of the needle at its lower end, the object may be turned
about, raised or depressed, brought nearer the glass, or put farther
from it, till you have the true focal distance, and the light be
seen reflected from the speculum strongly upon the object.<a href="#Footnote35" id="FNanchor35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote35"><a href="#FNanchor35" class="label">[35]</a> Opake microscopes are
now constructed more elegantly and simply. The chief merit of
Wilson&#8217;s microscope appears, in being particularly adapted to minute objects, and these principally
of the transparent kind; the barrel form is useful for excluding adventitious light.
Excepting these peculiarities, its general utility is considered far short of the universal pocket
microscope hereafter to be described. <span class="smcap">Edit.</span></p>

<h3>OF ELLIS&#8217;S SINGLE OR AQUATIC MICROSCOPE. <a href="#Plate7B">Plate VII. B.</a></h3>

<p>This instrument takes its name from Mr. John Ellis, author of
&#8220;An Essay towards a Natural History of Corallines,&#8221; and of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page120">[120]</span>
&#8220;Natural History of many curious and uncommon Zoophytes.&#8221;
By this instrument he was enabled to explain many singularities
in the &#339;conomy and construction of these wonderful productions
of nature. To the practical botanist this instrument is recommended
by the respectable authority of Mr. Curtis, author of the
Flora Londinensis, a work which does credit to the author and
the nation. This microscope is simple in its construction, easy in
its use, and very portable; these advantages, as well as some
others which it also has over other portable microscopes, have accelerated
the sale thereof, and caused it to be very much adopted.</p>

<h4>DESCRIPTION OF THE VARIOUS PARTS OF THE MICROSCOPE.</h4>

<p>K, the box which contains the whole apparatus; it is generally
made of fish-skin; on the top of the box there is a female screw,
for receiving the screw which is at the bottom of the brass pillar
A, and which is to be screwed on the top of the box, K. D, a
brass pin which fits into the pillar; on the top of this pin is a
hollow socket to receive the arm which carries the magnifiers;
the pin is to be moved up and down, in order to adjust the lenses
to their focal or proper distance from the object.</p>

<p>In the representation of this microscope, <a href="#Plate7B">Plate VII. B.</a> Fig. 1,
the pin, D, is delineated as passing through a socket at one side
of the pillar, A; it is now usual to make it pass down a hole
bored through the middle of the pillar.</p>

<p>E, the bar which carries the magnifying lens; it fits into the
socket, X, which is at the top of the pillar, D. This arm may
be moved backwards and forwards in the socket X, and sidewise
by the pin, D; so that the magnifier, which is screwed into the
ring at the end, E, of this bar, may be easily made to traverse
over any part of the object lying on the stage or plate B. F is
a polished silver speculum, with a magnifying lens placed at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page121">[121]</span>
center thereof, which is perforated for this purpose. The silver
speculum screws into the arm E, as at F. G, another speculum
of a different concavity from the former, with its lens. H, the
brass semicircle which supports the mirror, I; the pin, R, affixed
to the semicircle, H, passes through the hole which is towards
the bottom of the pillar, A. B, the stage or the plane on which
the objects are to be placed; it fits into a small dove-tailed arm
which is at the upper end of the pillar, A. C, a plane glass, with
a small piece of black silk stuck on it; this glass is fitted to a
groove made in the stage, B. M, a deep concave glass, to be laid
occasionally on the stage instead of the plane glass, C. L, a pair
of nippers; these are fixed to the hole of the stage, <i>a</i>, by the pin
K; the steel wire of these nippers slides backwards and forwards
in the socket, and this socket is moveable upwards and downwards
by means of the joint, so that the position of the object
may be varied at pleasure. The object may be fixed in the nippers,
stuck on the point, or affixed by a little gum-water, &amp;c. to
the ivory cylinder, N. O, a small pair of brass forceps to take
up minute objects by. P, a brush to clean the glasses.</p>

<p>To use this microscope; begin by screwing the pillar, A, to the
cover thereof; pass the pin, R, of the semicircle which carries the
mirror through the hole that is near the bottom of the pillar, A;
push the stage into the dove-tail at B; slide the pin into the
pillar, then pass the bar, E, through the socket, X, which is at
the top of the pin D, and screw one of the magnifying lenses into
the ring at F.</p>

<p>Now place the object either on the stage, or in the nippers L,
and in such a manner, that it may be as nearly as possible over
the center of the stage; bring the speculum, F, over the part you
mean to observe; then get as much light on the speculum as you
can, by means of the mirror, I; the light received on the speculum<span class="pagenum" id="Page122">[122]</span>
is reflected by it on the object. The distance of the lens, F,
from the object is regulated by moving the pin, D, up and down,
until a distinct view of it is obtained. The rule usually observed
is, to place the lens beyond its focal distance from the object, and
then gradually slide it down, till the object appears sharp and
well defined. The adjustment of the lenses to their foci, and
the distribution of the light on the object, are what require the
most attention.</p>

<p>These microscopes are sometimes fitted up with a rack and
pinion to the pillar A, and pin D, for the more ready adjustment
of the glasses to their proper foci.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">DESCRIPTION OF LYONET&#8217;S ANATOMICAL MICROSCOPE.</span>
<a href="#Plate6">Plate VI.</a> Fig. 3.</h3>

<p>Fig. 3 represents the instrument with which M. Lyonet made
his microscopical and wonderful dissection of the chenille de saule
or caterpillar of the goat moth,<a href="#Footnote36" id="FNanchor36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> of which a specimen is given in
<a href="#Plate12">Plate XII.</a> Fig. 1, &amp;c. of this work. This portable instrument needs
no further recommendation. By it, other observers may be enabled
to dissect insects in general with the same accuracy as M. Lyonet,
and thus advance the knowledge of comparative anatomy, by
which alone the characteristic, nature, and rank of animals, can
be truly ascertained.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote36"><a href="#FNanchor36" class="label">[36]</a> Phal&aelig;na cossus. Linn. 63.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>A B is the anatomical table, which is supported by the pillar
O N; this is screwed on the mahogany foot, D C. The table A B,
is prevented from turning round by means of two steady pins;
in this table or board there is a hole, G, which is exactly over
the center of the mirror, F E, that is to reflect the light on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page123">[123]</span>
object; the hole, G, is, designed to receive a flat or a concave
glass, on which the objects are to be placed that you design to
examine or dissect. R X Z is an arm formed of several balls and
sockets, by which means it may be moved in every possible position;
it is fixed to the board by means of the screw, H; the last
arm, I Z, has a female screw, into which a magnifier may be
screwed, as at Z. By means of the screw, H, a small motion
may be occasionally given to the arm I Z, for adjusting the lens
with accuracy to its focal distance from the object. Another
chain of balls is sometimes used, carrying a lens to throw light
upon the object; the mirror is also so mounted, as to be taken
from its place at K, and fitted on a clamp, by which it may be
fixed to any part of the table, A B.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><span class="smcap">To use the dissecting table.</span></h4>

<p class="hinline">Let the operator sit with
his left side near a light window; the instrument being placed on
a firm table, the side, D L, towards his breast, the observations
should be made with the left eye: this position is well adapted
for observing, drawing, or writing. In dissecting, the two elbows
are to be supported by the table on which the instrument rests,
the hands resting against the board, A B, in order to give it
greater stability, as a small shake, though imperceptible to the
naked eye, is very visible in the microscope; the dissecting instruments
are to be held one in each hand, between the thumb
and two fore-fingers. Farther directions are given on the mode
of dissecting small objects in the following chapter.</p>

<h3>DR. WITHERING&#8217;S BOTANICAL MICROSCOPE. <a href="#Plate6">Plate VI.</a> Fig. 1.</h3>

<p>This small instrument consists of three brass parallel plates,
A, B, C; two wires, D and E, are rivetted into the upper and
lower plate; the middle plate or stage is moveable on the aforesaid
wires, by two little sockets which are fixed to it. The two<span class="pagenum" id="Page124">[124]</span>
upper plates each contain a magnifying lens, but of different
powers; one of these confines and keeps in their places the fine
point F, the forceps G, and the small knife H.</p>

<p>To use this instrument, unscrew the upper lens, and take out
the point, the knife, and the forceps; then screw the lens on
again, place the object on the stage, and then move it up or
down till you have gained a distinct view of the object, as one
lens is made of a shorter focus than the other; and spare lenses
of a still deeper focus are sometimes added. The principal merit
of this microscope is its simplicity.</p>

<h3>THE POCKET BOTANICAL AND UNIVERSAL MICROSCOPE.</h3>

<p>This pocket instrument is represented at <a href="#Plate6">Plate VI.</a> Fig. 2. It is
by most naturalists deemed preferable to Dr. Withering&#8217;s, being
equally simple, more extensive in its application, and the stage
unincumbered; though that of M. Lyonet seems better adapted
than either to the purposes of dissection only.</p>

<p>A B, a small arm, carrying three magnifiers, two fixed to the
upper part, as at B, the other to the lower part of the arm, at C;
these may be used separately or combined together, by which
you have seven powers. The arm, A B, is supported by the
square pillar I K, the lower end of which fits into the socket, E,
of the foot, F G; the stage, D L, is made to slide up and down
the square pillar. H, a mirror for reflecting light on the object.</p>

<p>To use this microscope, place the object on the stage, L, reflect
the light on it from the mirror H, and regulate it to the focus, by
moving the stage nearer to or further from the lenses at B C. The
ivory sliders pass under the stage, L; other objects may be fixed
in the nippers, M N, and then brought under the magnifiers; or
they may be laid on one of the glasses fitted to the stage. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page125">[125]</span>
apparatus to this instrument consists of three ivory sliders, a pair
of nippers, a pair of forceps, a flat glass, and a concave ditto,
all fitted to the stage, L. By taking out the pin, M, the pillar,
I K, may be turned half round, and the foot, F G, made to answer
as an handle.<a href="#Footnote37" id="FNanchor37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote37"><a href="#FNanchor37" class="label">[37]</a> An adjusting screw,

<h3>BOTANICAL MAGNIFIERS.</h3>

<p>Since botany has been cultivated with so much ardor, it has
been found necessary to contrive some very portable instrument,
by which the botanist might investigate the object of his pursuits
as it rises before him. <a href="#Plate8">Plate VIII.</a> Fig. 7 and 8, represent two
of the most convenient sort.</p>

<p>In the tortoiseshell case, Fig. 7, three lenses are contained,
<i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, of different foci, which are all made to turn into the case,
and may be used combined or separately. The three lenses in
themselves afford three different magnifying powers; by combining
two and two, we make three more; and the three together
make, a seventh magnifying power. When the three lenses are
used together, it is best to turn them into the case, and look
through the hole, for more distinctness, and the exclusion of superfluous
light. In the case, Fig. 8, are also three lenses, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>,
of different magnifying powers, that all turn up, and shut into
the case; but these are not capable of combination.</p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION OF A PORTABLE MICROSCOPE AND TELESCOPE.
<a href="#Plate8">Plate VIII.</a> Fig. 1, to 6.</h3>

<p>The telescope is one of those which are composed of several
sliding drawers or tubes, for the convenience of being put into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page126">[126]</span>
pocket; the sliding tubes are made of thin brass, the outside
tube of mahogany. The sliding tubes are contrived to stop,
when drawn out to a proper length, so that by applying one hand
to the outside tube, and the other hand to the end of the smallest
tube, the telescope may at one pull be drawn out to its full
length; then any of the tubes (that next the eye is most generally
used) may be pushed in gradually, while you are looking through
it, till the object is rendered distinct to the eye. To make the
tubes slide properly, they all pass through short springs or tubes;
these springs may be unscrewed from the ends of the sliding
tubes, by means of the milled edges which project above the
tubes, and the tubes taken from each other if required, and the
springs set closer if at any time they be too weak.</p>

<p>Fig. 5 represents the exterior tube of the telescope, which is to
be unscrewed from the rest, at <i>m l</i>, as it does not make any part
of the microscope; the cover, <i>k</i>, which protects the object-glass,
serves also as a box to contain two ivory wheels, Fig. 1 and 2,
with the objects, and a small mirror, Fig. 6.</p>

<p>Fig. 4 is a view of this cover when taken off: unscrew the
top part of it, and the mirror, Fig. 6, may be taken out; unscrew
the cover of the lower part, and you will find therein the two
circular object-wheels above mentioned.</p>

<p>Fig. 3 represents the three internal tubes of the telescope,
which constitute the microscopic part thereof. Draw the tubes
out in the manner as shewn in the figure; then at the inside, but
at the lower end of the exterior tube, a, you will find a short tube,
which serves as a stage to hold the object and support the mirror;
pull this tube partly out, and turn it, so that a circular hole
which is pierced in it may coincide with a similar hole in the
exterior tube. This tube is represented as drawn out at Fig. 3,<span class="pagenum" id="Page127">[127]</span>
the mirror, Fig. 6, placed therein at <i>b c</i>, and the transparent object-wheel
fixed at a.</p>

<p>Fig. 1 represents the slider with transparent objects.</p>

<p>Fig. 2, that with the opake. They are made of ivory, and turn
on a pin at the center; the slit end of this pin fits on the edge of
the tube, which is then to be pushed up, so that the lower end of
the exterior tube may bear lightly on the upper side of the slider,
agreeable to the view which is given at a, Fig. 3. Now push down
the second tube till the milled part falls on the milled edge of the
extreme tube, being careful of the circular hole in the exterior
one. Nothing now remains to be done but to adjust for the focus,
which is effected by pushing in the tube R, and moving only
the first, <i>n</i>.</p>

<p>The instrument may be used in two ways for transparent objects:
first, in a vertical position, when the light is to be thrown
on the object by the mirror, <i>b c</i>; or it may be examined by looking
up directly at the light; in the latter case the mirror must be
taken away. In viewing opake objects the mirror is not used;
as much light as possible must be admitted on them through the
circular holes of the tubes. Any object may be viewed by first
pushing in the tube, R, and then bringing the tube, <i>n</i>, to its focal
distance from the object. The telescope, when shut up, is about
eight inches in length, and when drawn out, is about twenty
inches. It is of the achromatic construction.</p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION OF AN INSTRUMENT FOR CUTTING THIN TRANSVERSE
SECTIONS OF WOOD, <a href="#Plate9">Plate IX.</a> Fig. 1.</h3>

<p>It consists of a wooden base, which supports four brass pillars;
on the top of the pillars is placed a flat piece of brass, near the<span class="pagenum" id="Page128">[128]</span>
middle of which there is a triangular hole. A sharp knife which
moves in a diagonal direction, is fixed on the upper side of the
afore-mentioned plate, and in such a manner, that the edge always
coincides with the surface thereof. The knife is moved
backwards and forwards by means of the handle, <i>a</i>. The piece
of wood is placed in the triangular trough, which is under the
brass plate, and is to be kept steady therein by a milled screw
which is fitted to the trough; the wood is to be pressed forward
for cutting, by the micrometer screw, <i>b</i>. The pieces of wood
should be applied to this instrument immediately on being taken
out of the ground, or else they should be soaked for some time in
water, to soften them, so that they may not hurt the edge of the
knife. When the edge of the knife is brought in contact with
the piece of wood, a small quantity of spirit of wine should be
poured on the surface of the wood, to prevent its curling up; it
will also make it adhere to the knife, from which it may be removed
by pressing a piece of blotting paper on it.</p>

<p>Fig. 2, is an appendage to the cutting engine, which may be used
instead of the micrometer screw, being by some practitioners
preferred to it. It is placed over the triangular hole, and kept
flat down upon the surface of the brass plate, while the piece of
wood is pressed against a circular piece of brass which is on the
under side of it. This circular piece of brass is fixed to a screw,
by which its distance from the flat plate on which the knife
moves may be regulated.<a href="#Footnote38" id="FNanchor38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote38"><a href="#FNanchor38" class="label">[38]</a> Many other
kinds of cutting engines have been constructed, but the specimens from them
have not yet appeared with that perfection which is requisite to this sort of objects; whether it
lies in the preparation of the woods, or engine, I do not take upon me to determine. Mr. Custance
has certainly produced the most exquisite. <span class="smcap">Edit.</span></p>

<h2><span class="chapno">CHAP. IV.</span><br />
<span class="chapname">GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THE MICROSCOPE
AND PREPARING THE OBJECTS.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="startcapital">A</span>s the advantages which are obtained from any instrument
are considerably increased, if it be used by a person who is
master of its properties, attentive to its adjustments, and habituated
by practice to the minuti&aelig; of management, it is the design
of this chapter to point out those circumstances which more peculiarly
require the attention of the observer, and to give such
plain directions, as may enable him to examine any object with
ease; to shew how he may place it in the best point of view, and
if necessary, prepare it for observation.</p>

<p>A small degree of diligence will render the observer master of
every necessary rule, and a little practice will make them familiar
and habitual: the pains he takes to acquire these habits will
be rewarded by an increasing attachment to his instrument, and
the wonders it displays. Let him only persevere till he has overcome
the natural indolence that opposes the advancement of
every kind of knowledge, and he will most assuredly find himself
very amply recompensed, by the gratification arising from
the acquisition of a science that has the unlimited treasures of
<span class="smcapall">INFINITE WISDOM</span> for the object of its
researches: and his mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page130">[130]</span>
being strengthened by the victory it has gained, will be more keen
in perceiving, and more patient in the investigation of truth.</p>

<p>It has long been a complaint,<a href="#Footnote39" id="FNanchor39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> that many of those who purchase
microscopes are so little acquainted with their general and
extensive usefulness, and so much at a loss for objects to examine
by them, that after diverting themselves and their friends some
few times with what they find in the sliders, which generally
accompany the instrument, or perhaps two or three common
objects, the microscope is laid aside as of little further value:
whereas no instrument has yet appeared in the world capable of
affording so constant, various, and satisfactory an entertainment
to the mind. This complaint will, I hope, be obviated by these
Essays, in which I have endeavoured to make the use of the
microscope easy, point out an immense variety of objects, and
direct the observer how to prepare them for examination.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote39"><a href="#FNanchor39" class="label">[39]</a> Baker&#8217;s Microscope made Easy, p. 51.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The subject treated of in this chapter naturally divides itself
into three heads: the first describes the necessary preparation and
adjustment of the microscope; the second treats of the proper
quantity of the light, and the best method of adapting it to the
objects under examination; and the third shews how to prepare
and preserve the various objects, that their nature, organization,
and texture, may be properly understood.</p>

<h3>OF THE NECESSARY PREPARATION OF THE MICROSCOPE
FOR OBSERVATION.</h3>

<p>We have in the last chapter explained those particulars that
constitute the difference of one microscope from another, and
shewn the manner of using each instrument, and how the several<span class="pagenum" id="Page131">[131]</span>
parts are to be applied to it. We shall now proceed to give some
general directions applicable to every microscope. The observer
is therefore supposed to have made himself master of his instrument,
and to know how to adapt the different parts of the apparatus
to their proper places.</p>

<p>The first circumstance necessary to be examined into, is, whether
the different glasses belonging to the microscope are perfectly
clean or not; if they be not clean, they must be taken out
and wiped with a piece of wash leather, taking care at the same
time not to soil the surface of the glass with the fingers: in
replacing the glasses, you must also be careful not to lay them in
an oblique situation, to place the convex sides as before, and if
one glass be taken out, wiped, and replaced before the next, it
may prevent the misplacing of them by an unskilful hand.</p>

<p>The object should be brought as near the center of the field of
view as possible, for there only will it be exhibited in the greatest
perfection.</p>

<p>The eye should be moved up and down from the eye-glass of
a compound microscope, till you find that situation where the
largest field, and most distinct view of the object is obtained; and
as the sight differs very much in different persons, and even in
the same person, we frequently find each eye to have a different
sight from the other, particularly in those called myopes, or
short-sighted, every one ought to adjust the microscope to his
own eye, and not depend upon the situation in which it was
placed by another.</p>

<p>Care must be taken not to let the breath fall upon the eye-glass,
nor to hold that part of the body of the microscope where<span class="pagenum" id="Page132">[132]</span>
the glasses are placed with a warm hand, because the damp that
is expelled from the metal by the heat will be attracted and condensed
by the glasses, and obstruct the sight of the object.</p>

<p>The observer should always begin with a small magnifying
power; with this he will gain an accurate idea of the situation
and connection of the whole, and will therefore be less liable to
form any erroneous opinion, when the parts are viewed separately
by a deeper lens. By a shallow magnifier he will also discover
those parts which merit a further investigation. Objects that are
transparent will bear a much greater magnifying power than
those that are opake.</p>

<p>Every object should, if possible, be examined first in that position
which is most natural to it: if this circumstance be neglected,
very inadequate ideas of the structure of the whole, as
well as of the connection and use of the parts, will be formed.
If it be a living animal, care must be taken not to squeeze, hurt,
or discompose it.</p>

<p>There is a great difference between merely viewing an object
by the microscope, and investigating its nature: in the first, we
only consider the magnified representation thereof; in the second,
we endeavour to analyse and discover its nature and relation to
other objects. In the first case, we receive the impression of an
image formed by the action of the glasses; in the second, we
form our judgment by investigating this image. It is easy to
view the image which is offered to the eye, but not so easy to
form a judgment of the things that are seen; an extensive knowledge
of the subject, great patience, and many experiments, will
be found necessary for this purpose: for there are many circumstances
where the images seen may be very similar, though originating<span class="pagenum" id="Page133">[133]</span>
from substances totally different; it is here the penetration
of the observer will be exercised, to discover the difference,
and avoid error.<a href="#Footnote40" id="FNanchor40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote40"><a href="#FNanchor40" class="label">[40]</a> Fontana sur les Poisons, vol. ii, p. 245.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Hence Mr. Baker cautions us against forming too suddenly
an opinion of any microscopic object, and not to draw our inferences
till after repeated experiments and examinations of the
objects, in all lights and various positions; to pass no judgment
upon things extended by force, or contracted by dryness, or in
any manner out of a natural state, without making suitable allowances.</p>

<p>The true colour of objects cannot be properly determined when
viewed through the deepest magnifiers; for, as the pores and interstices
of an object are enlarged, according to the magnifying
power of the glasses made use of, the component parts of its substance
will appear separated many thousand times farther asunder
than they do to the naked eye; it is, therefore, very probable,
that the reflection of the light from these particles will be very
different, and exhibit different colours.</p>

<p>Some consideration is also necessary in forming a judgment of
the motion of living creatures, or even of fluids, when seen
through the microscope; for as the moving body, and the space
wherein it moves, are magnified, the motion will also be increased.</p>

<p>If an object be so opake as not to suffer any light to pass
through it, as much as possible must be thrown on its upper surface,
by that part of the apparatus which is peculiarly adapted to
opake objects. As the apertures of deep magnifiers are but small,
and consequently admit but little light, they are not proper for<span class="pagenum" id="Page134">[134]</span>
the examination of opake objects: this, however, naturally leads
us to our second head.</p>

<h3>OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE LIGHT.</h3>

<p>The pleasure arising from a just view of a microscopic object,
the distinctness of vision, &amp;c. depend on a due management of
the light, and adapting the quantity of it to the nature of the
object, and the focus of the magnifier; therefore, an object should
always be viewed in various degrees of light. It is difficult to
distinguish in some objects between a prominency and a depression,
between a shadow and a black stain; and in colour, between
a reflection and a whiteness; a truth which the reader will find
fully exemplified in the examination of the eye of the libellula,
and other flies, which will be found to appear exceedingly different
in one position of the light from what they do in another.</p>

<p>The brightness of an object depends on the quantity of light;
the distinctness of vision, on regulating the quantity to the object;
for some will be lost and drowned, as it were, in a quantity of
light that is scarce sufficient to render another visible, as a different
portion of light under the same apparatus will often exhibit
in perfection, or totally conceal an object in the substance to be
examined. This is more particularly the case with the animalcul&aelig;
infusori&aelig;, whose thin and transparent form blend as it were
with the water in which they swim; the degree of light must
therefore be suited to the object, which, if dark, will be seen
best in a strong and full light, but if very transparent, it should
be examined in a fainter.</p>

<p>A strong light may be thrown on an object various ways: first,
by means of the sun and a convex lens; for this purpose, place<span class="pagenum" id="Page135">[135]</span>
the microscope about three feet from a southern window; take a
deep convex lens, that is mounted in a semicircle and fixed on a
stand, so that its position may be easily varied; place this lens
between the object and the window, so that it may collect a
considerable number of the solar rays, and refract them on the
object, or the mirror of the microscope. If the light thus collected
from the sun be too powerful, it may be tempered by
placing a piece of oil paper, or a glass lightly greyed, between
the object and the lens: by these means, a convenient degree of
light may be obtained, and diffused in an equal manner over the
whole surface of an object, a circumstance that should be particularly
attended to; for if the light be thrown in an irregular
manner, that is, larger portions of it on some parts than on others,
it will not be distinctly exhibited.</p>

<p>Where the solar light is preferred, it will be found very convenient
to darken the room, and to reflect the rays of the sun on
the above mentioned lens, by means of the mirror of a solar microscope
fitted to the window-shutter; for, by this apparatus, the
observer will be enabled to preserve the light on his object, notwithstanding
the motion of the sun.</p>

<p>Cutting off the adventitious light as much as possible, by
darkening the room where you are using the microscope, and
admitting the light only through a hole in the window-shutter, or
at most, keeping one window only open, will also be found very
conducive towards producing a distinct view of the object.</p>

<p>As the motion of the sun, and the variable state of our atmosphere,
render solar observations both tedious and inconvenient,
it will be proper for the observer to be furnished with a large tin
lanthorn, made something like the common magic lanthorn, fit to<span class="pagenum" id="Page136">[136]</span>
contain one of Argand&#8217;s lamps.<a href="#Footnote41" id="FNanchor41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The lanthorn should have an
aperture in front, that may be moved up and down, and capable
of holding a lens; by this a pleasing uniform dense light may be
easily procured. The lamp should move on a rod, that it may be
readily elevated or depressed. The lanthorn may be used for
many other purposes, as for viewing of pictures, exhibiting microscopic
objects on a screen, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote41"><a href="#FNanchor41" class="label">[41]</a> The lamp
should not be of the fountain kind, because the rarefaction of the air in the lanthorn
will often force the oil over.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Many transparent objects are seen best in a weak light; among
these we may place the prepared eyes of flies and animalcul&aelig; in
fluids; the quantity of light from a lamp or candle may be lessened
by removing the microscope to a greater distance from them, or
it may be more effectually lessened by cutting off a part of the
cone of rays that fall on the object, either by placing the cone, as
already described with the apparatus to different microscopes,
under the stage, or by forming circular apertures of black paper
of different sizes, and placing either a large or small one on the
reflecting mirror, as occasion may require.</p>

<p>There is an oblique position of the mirrors, and consequently
of the light, which is easily acquired by practice, but for which
no general rule can be given, that will exhibit an object more
beautifully and more distinctly than any other situation, shewing
the surface, as well as those parts through which the light is
transmitted.</p>

<p>A better view of most objects is obtained by a candle or lamp
than by day-light; it is more easy to modify the former than the
latter, and to throw it on the object with different degrees of<span class="pagenum" id="Page137">[137]</span>
density. From what has been said, the reader will have observed
the importance of being able to examine the object in the greatest
variety of positions and appearances, which cannot be effected
with equal convenience by any microscope, but the improved
lucernal.</p>

<h3>OF THE PREPARATION OF OBJECTS FOR THE MICROSCOPE.</h3>

<p>In the preparation of objects, no man was more successful or
more indefatigable than Swammerdam. In minutely anatomizing,
in patiently investigating, and in curiously exhibiting the
minute wonders of the creation, he stands unrivalled, far exceeding
all those that preceded, as well as those which have succeeded
him. Deeply impressed and warmly animated by the amazing
scenes that he continually discovered, his zeal in pursuit of truth
was not to be abated by disappointment, or alarmed by difficulty;
and he was never satisfied till he had attained a rational and clear
idea of the organization of the object, whose structure he wished
to explore; his &#8220;Book of Nature,&#8221; of which a translation was
published by Dr. Hill, is a work of such vast extent of knowledge,
and so excellent in execution, as to raise the highest admiration
in even a superficial observer.</p>

<p>It is much to be regretted, that we are ignorant of the methods
he employed in his investigations. To discover these, the great
Boerhaave examined with a scrupulous attention all the letters
and manuscripts of Swammerdam, and has communicated the
result of his researches, which, though but small, may enable us
to form some idea of his immense labours in the field of science.</p>

<p>For dissecting of small insects he had a brass table, which was
made by that excellent artist, S. Musschenbroeck; to this table<span class="pagenum" id="Page138">[138]</span>
were affixed two brass arms, moveable at pleasure to any part of
it. The upper portion of these arms was constructed so as to
have a slow vertical motion, by which means the operator could
readily alter their height, as he saw most convenient to his purpose;
the office of one of these arms was to hold the minute bodies,
and that of the other to apply the lens or microscope.</p>

<p>His microscopes or lenses were of various foci, diameters, and
sizes, from the least to the greatest, and the best that could be
procured in regard to the exactness of the workmanship, and
transparency of the substance. His mode was, to begin his observations
with the smallest magnifiers, and from thence proceed
by degrees to the greatest. Formed by nature, and habituated by
experience, he was so incomparably dexterous in the management
of these instruments, that he made every observation subservient
to the next, and all tend to confirm each other, and
complete the description.</p>

<p>His chief art seems to have been in constructing very fine
scissars, and giving them an extreme sharpness: these he made
use of to cut very minute objects, because they dissected them
equally; whereas knives and lancets, let them be ever so fine and
sharp, are apt to disorder delicate substances, as in going through
them, they generally draw after and displace some of the filaments.
His knives, lancets and styles, were so very fine, that he could
not see to sharpen them without the assistance of a magnifying
glass; but with them he could dissect the intestines of bees with
the same accuracy and distinctness that the most celebrated anatomist
does those of large animals. He was particularly expert
in the management of small glass tubes, which were no thicker
than a bristle, and drawn to a very fine point at one end, but
thicker at the other. These he made use of to shew and blow<span class="pagenum" id="Page139">[139]</span>
up the smallest vessels discovered by the microscope, to trace,
distinguish, and separate their courses and communications, or to
inject them with very subtil coloured liquors.</p>

<p>He used to suffocate the insects in spirit of wine, in water, or
spirit of turpentine, and likewise preserved them for some time
in these liquids; by which means he kept the parts from putrefaction,
and consequently from collapsing and mixing together;
and added to them besides such strength and firmness, as rendered
the dissections more easy and agreeable. When he had divided
transversely with his fine scissars the little creature he intended to
examine, and had carefully noted every thing that appeared without
further dissection, he then proceeded to extract the viscera in
a very cautious and deliberate manner, with other instruments of
great fineness; first taking care to wash away and separate with
very fine pencils, the fat with which insects are very plentifully
supplied, and which always prejudices the internal parts before it
can be extracted. This operation is best performed upon insects
while in the nympha state.</p>

<p>Sometimes he put into water the delicate viscera of the insects
he had suffocated; and then shaking them gently he procured
himself an opportunity of examining them, especially the air vessels,
which by these means he could separate from all the other
parts whole and intire, to the great admiration of all those who
beheld them; as these vessels are not to be distinctly seen in any
other manner, or indeed seen at all without damaging them, he
often made use of water, injected by a syringe, to cleanse thoroughly
the internal parts, then blew them up with air and dried
them, and thus rendered them durable, and fit for examination at
a proper opportunity. Sometimes he has examined with the
greatest success, and made the most important discoveries in insects
that he had preserved in balsam, and kept for years together<span class="pagenum" id="Page140">[140]</span>
in that condition. Again, he has frequently made punctures in
other insects with a very fine needle, and after squeezing out all
their moisture through the holes made in this manner, he filled
them with air, by means of very slender glass tubes, then dried
them in the shade, and last of all anointed them with oil of spike,
in which a little rosin had been dissolved; by which process they
retained their proper forms a long time. He had a singular
secret, whereby he could so preserve the nerves of insects, that
they used to continue as limber and perspicuous as ever they
had been.</p>

<p>He used to make a small puncture or incision in the tail of
worms, and after having gently and with great patience squeezed
out all their humours, and great part of their viscera, he then injected
them with wax, so as to give and continue to them all the
appearance of healthy vigorous living creatures. He discovered
that the fat of all insects was perfectly dissoluble in oil of turpentine;
thus he was enabled to shew the viscera plainly; only
after this dissolution he used to cleanse and wash them well and
often in clean water. He frequently spent whole days in thus
cleansing a single caterpillar of its fat, in order to discover the
true construction of this insect&#8217;s heart. His singular sagacity in
stripping off the skin of caterpillars that were upon the point of
spinning their cones, deserves particular notice. This he effected
by letting them drop by their threads into scalding water, and
suddenly withdrawing them; for, by these means the epidermis
peeled off very easily; and when this was done, he put them into
distilled vinegar and spirit of wine, mixed together in equal portions,
which, by giving a proper firmness to the parts, gave him
an opportunity of separating them with very little trouble from
the exuvi&aelig;, or skins, without any danger to the parts; so that by
this contrivance, the nymph could be shewn to be wrapped up
in the caterpillar and the butterfly in the nymph. Those who<span class="pagenum" id="Page141">[141]</span>
look into the works of Swammerdam, will be abundantly gratified,
whether they consider his astonishing labour and unremitted
ardour in these pursuits, or his wonderful devotion and piety.
On one hand, his genius urged him to examine the miracles of
the great Creator in his natural, productions; whilst, on the other,
the love of that same all-perfect Being rooted in his mind struggled
hard to persuade him that God alone, and not the creatures,
were worthy of his researches, love, and attention.</p>

<p>M. Lyonet always drowned first those insects he intended to
anatomize, as by these means he was enabled to preserve both the
softness and transparency of the parts. If the insect, &amp;c. be very
small, for instance one-tenth of an inch, or a little more in length,
it should be dissected in water, on a glass which is a little concave;
if, after a few days, there be any fear that the insect will
putrefy, it should be placed in weak spirit of wine, instead of
water. In order to fix the little creature, it must be suffered to
dry, and then be fastened by a piece of soft wax; after which it
may be again covered with water.</p>

<p>Larger objects require a different process; they should be placed
in a small trough of thin wood; the bottom of a common chip
box will answer very well, by surrounding the edge of it with
soft wax, to keep in the water or spirit of wine. The insect
is then to be opened, and if the parts be soft, like those of a
caterpillar, they should be turned back and fixed to the trough
by small pins; the pins are to be set by a pair of small nippers,
the skin being stretched at the same instant by another pair of
finer forceps; the insect must then be placed in water, and dissected
therein, and after two or three days it should be covered
with spirit of wine, which should be renewed occasionally; by
these means the subject is preserved in perfection, and its parts
may be gradually unfolded, without any other change being perceived<span class="pagenum" id="Page142">[142]</span>
than that the soft elastic parts become stiff and opake, and
some others lose their colour.</p>

<p>M. Lyonet used the following instruments in his curious dissection
of the caterpillar of the cossus. As small a pair of
scissars as could be made, the arms long and fine; a small and
sharp knife, the end brought to a point; a pair of forceps, the
ends of which had been so adjusted, that they would easily lay
hold of a spider&#8217;s thread or a grain of sand. But the most useful
instruments were two fine steel needles, fixed in small wooden
handles, about 2-<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> of an inch in length.</p>

<p>An observation of Dr. Hooke&#8217;s may be very useful if attended
to, for fixing objects intended to be delineated by the microscope.
He found no creature more troublesome to draw than the ant or
pismire, not being able to get the body quite in a natural posture.
If, when alive, its feet were fettered with wax or glue, it would
so twist and twine its body, that it was impossible any way
to get a good view of it; if it was killed, the body was so small,
that the shape was often spoiled before it could be examined.
It is the nature of many minute bodies, when their life is destroyed,
for the parts to shrivel up immediately; this is very
observable in many small plants, as well as in insects; the surface
of these small bodies, if porous, being affected by almost every
change of the air, and this is particularly the case with the ant.
But if the little creature be dropped in well rectified spirit or
wine, it is immediately killed; and when taken out, the spirit of
wine evaporates, leaving the animal dry and in its natural posture,
or at least so constituted, that you may easily place it with
a pin in what posture you please.<a href="#Footnote42" id="FNanchor42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page143">[143]</span></p>

<p>Having thus given a general account of the methods used by
Swammerdam and Lyonet, in their examination and dissection of
insects, we shall proceed to shew how to prepare several of their
parts for the microscope, beginning with the <span class="smcapall">WINGS</span>. Many of
these are so transparent and clear, as to require no previous preparation;
but the under wings of those that are covered with
elytra, or crustaceous cases, being constantly folded up when at
rest, they must be unfolded before they can be examined by the
microscope; for this purpose a considerable share of dexterity and
some patience is necessary, for the natural spring of the wings is
so strong, that they immediately fold themselves again, except
they are carefully prevented.</p>

<p>One of the most curious and beautiful wings of this kind, is
that of the <span class="smcapall">FORFICULA AURICULARIA</span>, or <span class="smcapall">EARWIG</span>, of which
we have given a drawing, <a href="#Plate14">Plate XIV.</a> Fig. 1, represents it considerably
magnified, and Fig. 2, the same object of its natural
size. When expanded, it is a tolerably large wing, yet folds up
under a case not one-eighth part of its size. It is very difficult
to unfold these wings, on account of their curious texture. They
are best opened immediately after the insect is killed. Hold the
earwig by the thorax, between the finger and thumb; then with
a blunt-pointed pin endeavour gently to open the wing by
spreading it over the fore-finger, gradually sliding at the same
time the thumb over it. When fully expanded, separate it from
the insect by a sharp knife, or a pair of scissars. The wing should
be pressed for some time between the thumb and finger before it
be removed; it may then be placed between two pieces of paper,
and again pressed for at least an hour; after which it may be put
between the talcs without any danger of folding up again.</p>

<p>The wings of the <span class="smcapall">NOTONECTA</span>, or <span class="smcapall">BOAT-FLY</span>, and other water
insects, as well as most species of the grylli, require equal care<span class="pagenum" id="Page144">[144]</span>
and delicacy with that of the earwig to display them properly.</p>

<p>The wings of <span class="smcapall">BUTTERFLIES</span> and <span class="smcapall">MOTHS</span> are covered with very
minute scales or feathers, that afford a beautiful object for the
microscope; near the shoulder, the thorax, the middle of the
wing, and the fringes of the wings, they are generally intermixed
with hair. The scales of one part, also, often differ in shape
from those of another; they may be first scraped off or loosened
from the wing with a knife, and then brushed into a piece of
paper with a camel&#8217;s hair pencil; the scales may be separated from
the hairs with the assistance of a common magnifying glass.</p>

<p>The proboscis of insects, as of the <span class="smcapall">CULEX</span> or
<span class="smcapall">GNAT</span>, the <span class="smcapall">TABANUS</span>
or <span class="smcapall">BREEZE-FLY</span>, &amp;c. requires much attention and considerable
care to be dissected properly for the microscope; and many
must be prepared before the observer desides upon the situation
and shape of the parts; he will often also be able to unfold in
one specimen some parts that he can scarce discover in another.
It is well known that the <span class="smcapall">COLLECTOR OF THE BEE</span> forms a most
beautiful object; a figure of it is given in <a href="#Plate13">plate XIII.</a> Fig. 3,
shews it greatly magnified, and Fig. 4, of the natural size. In it
is displayed a most wonderful mechanism, admirably adapted to
collect and extract the various sweets from flowers, &amp;c. To
prepare this, it should first be carefully washed with spirit of
turpentine, by which means it will be freed from the unctuous
and melliferous particles which usually adhere to it; when dry,
it must be again washed with a camel&#8217;s hair pencil, to disengage
and bring forward the small hairs which form one part of its
microscopic beauty.</p>

<p>The case which encloses <span class="smcapall">THE STING OF THE BEE</span>, the wasp,
and the hornet, are so hard, that it is very difficult to extract<span class="pagenum" id="Page145">[145]</span>
them without breaking or otherwise injuring them. It will be
found, perhaps, the best way to soak the case, and the rest of the
apparatus for some time in spirit of wine or turpentine, then lay
it on a piece of clean paper, and with a blunt knife draw out the
sting, holding the sheath by the nail of the finger, or by any blunt
instrument; great care is requisite to preserve the feelers, which
when cleaned add much to the beauty of the object.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcapall">EYES OF THE LIBELLULA</span> or <span class="smcapall">DRAGON-FLY</span>, and different
flies, of the <span class="smcapall">LOBSTER</span>, &amp;c. are first to be cleaned from the blood
and other extraneous matter; they should then be soaked in water
for some days, after which you may separate one or two skins
from the eye, which, if they remain, render it too opake and confused;
some care is, however requisite in this separation, otherwise
the skin may be made too thin, so as not to enable you to
form an accurate idea of its organization.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcapall">EXUVI&AElig;</span> or <span class="smcapall">CAST-OFF OF SKINS</span> of insects are in general very
pleasing objects, and require but little preparation. If they be
curled or bent up, keep them in a moist atmosphere for a few
hours, and they will soon become so relaxed that you may extend
them with ease to their natural positions. The steam of warm
water answers the purpose very well.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcapall">BEARD OF THE LEPAS ANATIFERA</span> or <span class="smcapall">BARNACLE</span> is to be
soaked in clean soft water, and frequently brushed, while wet,
with a camel&#8217;s hair pencil; it may then be left to dry; after
which it must be again brushed with a dry pencil, to disengage
and separate the hairs, which are apt to adhere together. A picture
of this object is represented in <a href="#Plate13">plate XIII.</a> Fig. 1, magnified;
Fig. 2, natural size.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page146">[146]</span></p>

<p>To view the <span class="smcapall">MUSCULAR FIBRES</span>, take a very thin piece of dried
flesh, lay it upon a slip of glass, and moisten it with warm
water; when this is evaporated, the vessels will appear plain and
more visible, and by repeated macerations the parts may be further
disengaged.</p>

<p>To examine <span class="smcapall">FAT</span>, <span class="smcapall">BRAINS</span>, and other similar substances, we are
advised by Dr. Hooke to render the surface smooth, by pressing
it between two thin plates of flat glass, by which the substance
will be made much thinner and more transparent; otherwise,
the parts lying thick one upon the other, it appears confused and
indistinct.</p>

<p>Some substances are, however, so organized, that if their peculiar
form be altered, the parts we wish to discover are destroyed;
such as nerves, tendons, muscular fibres, pith of wood, &amp;c. Many
of these are best to be examined while floating in some convenient
transparent fluid. For instance, very few of the fibres of
any of the muscles can be discovered when they are viewed in
the open air; but if placed in water or oil, great part of their
wonderful fabric may be discovered. If the thread of a ligament
be viewed in this manner, it will be seen to consist of an indefinite
number of smooth round threads lying close together.</p>

<p>Objects of an elastic nature should be pulled or stretched out
while they are under the microscope, that the texture and nature
of those parts, whose figure is altered by being thus pulled out,
may be more fully discovered.</p>

<p>To examine <span class="smcapall">BONES</span> with the microscope. These should first
be viewed as opake objects; afterwards, by procuring thin sections,
they should be looked at as if transparent. The sections<span class="pagenum" id="Page147">[147]</span>
should be cut in all directions, and be well washed and cleaned;
a degree of maceration will be useful in some cases. Or the
bones may be put in a clear fire till they are red hot, and then
taken out; by these means the bony cells will appear more conspicuous
and visible, being freed from extraneous matter.</p>

<p>To examine the <span class="smcapall">PORES OF THE SKIN</span>. First, cut or pare off
with a razor as thin a slice as possible of the upper skin; then cut
a second from the same place; apply the last to the microscope.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcapall">SCALES OF FISH</span> should be soaked in water for a few
days, and then be carefully rubbed, to clean them from the skin
and dirt which may adhere to them.</p>

<p>To procure the scales of the eel, which are a great curiosity,
and the more so, as the eel was not known to have any, till they
were discovered by the microscope, take a piece of the skin of
the eel that grows on the side, and while it is moist spread it on
a piece of glass, that it may dry very smooth; when thus dried,
the surface will appear all over dimpled or pitted by the scales,
which lie under a sort of cuticle or thin skin; this skin may be
raised with the sharp point of a penknife, together with the scales
which will then easily slip out, and thus you may procure as
many as you please.<a href="#Footnote43" id="FNanchor43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>On the lizard, the guana, &amp;c. are two skins; one of these is
very transparent, the other is thicker and more opake; by separating
these we procure two beautiful objects.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcapall">LEAVES</span> of many trees, and some plants, when dissected,
form a very pleasing object. To dissect them, take a few of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page148">[148]</span>
most perfect leaves you can find, and place them in a pan with
clean water; let them remain three weeks or a month without
changing the water, then take them up, and try if they feel very
soft, and appear almost rotten; if so, they are sufficiently soaked.
You are then to lay them on a flat board, and holding them by the
stalk, draw the edge of the knife over the upper side of the leaf,
which will take off most of the skin; turn the leaf, and do the
same with the under side. When the skin is taken off on both
sides, wash out the pulpy matter, and the fibres will be exhibited
in a beautiful manner. By slitting the stalk you may separate
the anatomized leaf into two parts. The skins that are peeled
from the fibres will also make a very good object. The autumn is
the best season for the foregoing operation, as the fibres of the
leaves are much stronger at that season, and less liable to break.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ores</span> and <span class="smcapall">MINERALS</span> should all be carefully washed and
cleansed with a small brush, to remove any extraneous matter that
may adhere to them. <span class="smcap">Shells</span> may be ground down on a hone, by
which their internal structure will be displayed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To view the circulation and examine the particles
of the blood.</span> The principal part the observer must aim at,
in order to view the circulation of the blood, is to procure those
small animals or insects that are most transparent, that by seeing
through them he may be enabled to discover the internal motion.
The particular kinds best adapted for the purpose will be enumerated
in the descriptive catalogue at the end of this work.</p>

<p>If a small eel be used for this purpose, it must be cleansed from
the slime which covers it; after which it maybe put either in
the fish-pan, or a glass tube filled with water, and then placed
under the microscope. If the eel be small enough, the circulation
may be viewed in the most satisfactory manner. Leeuwenhoeck<span class="pagenum" id="Page149">[149]</span>
has given, in his 112th Epistle, an accurate description of
the blood vessels in part of the tail of an eel. The same figure
may also be seen in my father&#8217;s Micrographia Illustrata, fourth
edition, <a href="#Plate17">Plate XVII</a>. The tail of any other small fish may be applied
in the same manner, or tied on a slip of flat glass, and be
thus laid before the microscope. Flounders, eels, and gudgeons,
are to be had at almost any time in London. N. B. By filling
the tube with water, when an eel is used, it will in a great measure
prevent the sliminess of the eel from soiling the glass.</p>

<p>To view the particles of the blood, take a small drop of it
when warm, and spread it as thin as possible upon a flat piece of
glass. By diluting it a little with warm water, some of the
larger particles will divide from the smaller, and many of them
will be subdivided into still smaller; or a little drop of blood may
be put into a capillary tube of glass, and be then presented before
the microscope. Mr. Baker advises the mixing the blood with a
little warm milk, which he says, will cause the unbroken particles
to be very distinctly seen. But the most accurate observer of
these particles was Mr. Hewson, and he says they have been
termed globules with great impropriety, being in reality flat bodies.
When we consider how many ingenious persons have been
employed in examining the blood with the best microscopes, it
appears surprizing that the figure of the particles should be mistaken;
but the wonder is lessened when we reflect how many
obvious things are overlooked, till our attention is particularly
directed towards them; and besides, the blood in the human subject,
and in quadrupeds, is so full of these particles, that it is with
great difficulty they can be seen separate, until the blood is diluted.
It was by discovering a proper method to effect this, that
Mr. Hewson was indebted for his success. He diluted the particles
with serum, in which they would remain undissolved, and as
he could dilute them to any degree with the serum, he could easily<span class="pagenum" id="Page150">[150]</span>
examine the particles distinct from each other; for example, take
a small quantity of the serum of the human blood, and shake a
piece of crassamentum in it, till it be coloured a little with the
red particles; then with a soft hair pencil spread a little of it on a
piece of thin glass, and place this glass under the microscope, in
such a manner as not to be quite horizontal, but rather higher at
one end than the other; by which means the serum will flow
from the higher to the lower extremity, and as it flows, some of
the particles will be found to swim on their flat sides, and will
appear to have a dark spot in the middle; others will turn over
from one side to the other, as they roll down the glass.</p>

<p>Several authors have described an apparatus for viewing the
circulation of the blood in the mesentery of a frog; but as the cruelty
attendant on these kinds of investigations would deprive the
humane reader of a great part of the gratification which might
otherwise result from them, he will probably rest satisfied with
the accounts of such experiments to be met with in authors; especially
as there is an abundant variety of objects on which he may
exercise his ingenuity without sacrificing the nicer feelings of
humanity.<a href="#Footnote44" id="FNanchor44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>It may, however, be doubted whether this particular instance is strictly conformable to fact;
different animals certainly possess different degrees of sensibility, and some are consequently
more susceptible of pain than others. It is a remarkable circumstance that the Hippobosca
equina, or Horse-fly, will live, run, nay even copulate, after being deprived of its head; most
flies will survive that loss for some time, and the loss of a leg or two does not prevent their
appearing as lively and alert as if they had sustained no injury. Many insects, on being caught,
will freely and voluntarily part with their limbs to escape; and it is well known that lobsters
shed their claws. Numbers of other instances might be adduced, but on this subject it may be
prudent not to enlarge.</p>

<p>Montaigne remarks, that there is a certain claim of kindness and benevolence which every
species of creatures has a right to, from us. It is to be regretted, that this general maxim is not
more attended to in the affairs of education, and pressed home upon tender minds in its full
extent and latitude; the early delight which children discover in tormenting different animals
should by all possible means be discouraged, as, by being unrestrained in such sports, they may
at least acquire a habit of confirmed inattention to every kind of suffering but their own, if not
progressively be led to the perpetration of more atrocious acts of cruelty. The supreme court
of judicature at Athens thought an instance of this sort not below its cognizance, and punished
a boy for putting out the eyes of a poor bird that had unhappily fallen into his hands; and the
inimitable <span class="smcap">Hogarth</span>, &#8220;the great painter of
mankind,&#8221; has in his &#8220;Five Stages of Cruelty,&#8221;
admirably depicted the consequences which may result from an early indulgence of a propensity
towards cruelty.</p>

<p>In order to awaken as early as possible in the minds of children an extensive sense of humanity,
it might be prudent to indulge them with a view of several sorts of insects as magnified by
the microscope, and to explain to them that the same marks of divine wisdom prevail in the
formation of the minutest insect, as in the most enormous leviathan; that they are equally
furnished with whatever is necessary, not only for the preservation, but the happiness of their
beings, in that class of existence which Providence has assigned them: in a word, that the
whole construction of their respective organs distinctly and decisively, proclaims them the
objects of divine benevolence, and therefore they justly ought to be so of ours. <span class="smcap">Edit.</span></p>

<h4>OF ANIMALCULA IN INFUSIONS, &amp;C.</h4>

<p>These require little or no preparation. The first object is to
procure them, the second, to render them visible by the microscope.
A few observations, however, may be of use. Many
drops of water may be examined before any can be found; so
that if the observer be too hasty, he may be easily disappointed,
though other parts of the same water may be fully peopled by
them.</p>

<p>The surface of infused liquors is generally covered with a thin
pellicle, which is easily broken, but acquires thickness by standing;
the greatest number of animalcula are generally to be found
in this superficial film.</p>

<p>In some cases it is necessary to dilute the infusions; but this is
always to be done with distilled water, and that water should be
examined in the microscope before it is made use of: the neglect
of this precaution has been a source of many errors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page152">[152]</span></p>

<p>Animalcula are in general better observed when the water is a
little evaporated, as the eye is not confused, nor the attention
diverted by a few objects. To separate one or two animalcula
from the rest, place a small drop of water on the glass near that
of the infusion; make a small neck or gutter between the two
drops with a pin, which will join them together; then the instant
you perceive that an animalculum has traversed the neck or gutter,
and entered the drop, cut off the communication between the
two drops.</p>

<p>To procure the eels in paste, boil a little flower and water, till
it becomes of a moderate consistence; expose it to the air in
an open vessel, and beat it together from time to time, to prevent
the surface thereof from growing hard or mouldy; after a
few days, especially in summer time, it will turn sower, then if it
be examined with attention, you will find myriads of eels on the
surface.</p>

<p>To preserve these eels all the year, you must keep the surface
of the paste moist, by putting a little water or fresh paste from<span class="pagenum" id="Page153">[153]</span>
time to time to the other. Mr. Baker advises a drop or two of
vinegar to be put into the paste now and then. The continual
motion of the eels, while the surface is moist, will prevent the
paste getting mouldy. Apply them to the microscope upon a
slip of flat glass, first putting on it a drop of water, taken up by
the head of a pin, for them to swim in.</p>

<p>To make an infusion of pepper. Bruise as much common
black pepper as will cover the bottom of an open jar, and lay it
thereon about half an inch thick; pour as much soft water in the
vessel as will rise about an inch above the pepper. The pepper
and water are then to be well shaken together; after which they
must not be stirred, but be left exposed to the air for a few days,
when a thin pellicle will be formed on the surface of the water,
containing millions of animalcula.</p>

<p>The observer should be careful not to form a judgment of the
nature, the use, and the operations of small animalcula, from ideas
which he has acquired by considering the properties of larger
animals: for, by the assistance of glasses, we are introduced as it
were into a new world, and become acquainted not only with a
few unknown animals, but with numerous species thereof, which
are so singular in their formation and habits, that without the
clearest proofs even their existence would not be credited; and
while they afford fresh instances of the Creator&#8217;s power, they also
give further proofs of the limits and weakness of the human understanding.</p>

<h4>DIRECTIONS FOR FINDING, FEEDING, AND PRESERVING
THE POLYPES.</h4>

<p>These little animals are to be found upon all sorts of aquatic
plants, upon branches of trees, pieces of board, rotten leaves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page154">[154]</span>
stones, and other substances that lie in the water; they are also
to be met with upon the bodies of several aquatic animals, as on
the water-snail, on several species of the monoculus, &amp;c. they
generally fix themselves to these by their tail, so that it is a very
good method when you are in search of the polypes, to take up a
great many of these substances, and put them in a glass full of
water. If there be any polypes adhering to these, you will soon
perceive them stretching out their arms, especially if the glass be
suffered to be at rest for a while; for the polypes, which contract
themselves on being first taken out of the water, will soon extend
again when they are at rest.</p>

<p>They are to be sought for in the corners of ditches, puddles,
and ponds, being frequently driven into these with the pieces of
wood or leaves to which they have attached themselves. You
may, therefore, search for them in vain at one period, in a place
where at another they will be found in abundance. They are
more easily perceived in a ditch when the sun shines on the bottom,
than at another time. In winter they are seldom to be met
with; about the month of May they begin to appear and increase.</p>

<p>They are generally to be found in waters which move gently;
for neither a rapid stream, nor stagnant waters ever abound with
them. As they are always fixed to some substance by their tails,
and are very rarely loose in the water, taking up water only can
signify but little; a circumstance which has probably been the
cause of much disappointment to those who have searched for
them.</p>

<p>The green polypes are usually about half an inch long when
stretched out; those of the second and third sort are between
three quarters of an inch and an inch in length, though some are
to be found at times which are an inch and a half long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page155">[155]</span></p>

<p>Heat and cold has the same effect upon these little creatures,
that it has upon those of a larger size. They are animated and
enlivened by heat, whereas cold renders them faint and languid;
they should therefore be kept in such a degree of heat, that the
water may not be below temperate.</p>

<p>It is convenient for many experiments to suspend a polype
from the surface of the water. To effect this, take a hair pencil
in one hand, and hold a pointed quill in the other; with the pencil
loosen the polype from the receiver in which it is kept, and
gradually raise it near the top of the water, so that the anterior
end may be next the point of the pencil; then lift it out of the
water, and keep it so for a minute; after which, thrust the point
of the pencil, together with the anterior end, by little and little
under water, until no more than about the twentieth part of an
inch of the polype&#8217;s tail remains above its surface; at this instant,
with the pointed quill remove that part of the polype from the
pencil which is already in the water, at the same time blowing
against the polype, by which it will be loosened, and remain out
of the water.</p>

<p>When the polypes were first discovered, Mr. Trembley had
some difficulty to find out the food which was proper for them;
but he soon discovered, that a small species of the millepede answered
the purpose very well: the pulices aquatices have also
been recommended. The small red worms, which are to be
found on the mud-banks of the Thames, particularly near the
shores, answer the purpose also, they are easily found when the
tide is out, when they rise in such swarms on the surface of the
mud, that it appears of a red colour. These worms are an excellent
food for the polype. If a sufficient quantity be gathered in
November, and put into a large glass full of water, with three or
four inches of earth at the bottom, you will have a supply for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page156">[156]</span>
polypes all the winter. They may also be fed with common
worms, with the larva of gnats and other insects, and even with
butcher&#8217;s meat, &amp;c. if it be cut small enough.</p>

<p>River, or any soft water, agrees with them; but that which is
hard and sharp prevents their thriving, and generally kills them in
a few days. The worms with which they are fed should be always
cleansed before you feed the polypes with them.</p>

<p>The polypes are commonly infested with little lice; from these
it is necessary to free them, in order to preserve your polypes
in a good state of health. They may be cleansed from the lice
by rubbing them with a hair pencil; this cannot be easily done,
unless they adhere to some substance: so that if they are suspended
from the surface of the water, you must endeavour to get
them to fix themselves to a piece of packthread; when they are
fastened thereto, you may then rub them with a hair pencil,
without loosening them from the thread.</p>

<p>The lice which torment the polype are not only very numerous,
but they are also very large proportionably to its size: they
may be said to be nearly as large with respect to them, as a common
beetle is to us. If not rubbed off, they soon cover their
bodies, and in a little time totally destroy them.</p>

<p>To preserve the polypes in health, it is also necessary often to
change the water they are kept in, and particularly after they
have done eating; it is not sufficient to pour the water off, all
the polypes should be taken out, and the bottom and sides of the
vessel rubbed from the slimy sediment adhering thereto; this is
caused by their f&aelig;ces, and is fatal to them if not cleaned away.
The f&aelig;ces often occasion a species of mortification, which
daily increases; its progress may be stopped by cutting off the<span class="pagenum" id="Page157">[157]</span>
diseased part. To take them out, first loosen their tails from the
sides or bottom of the glass; then take them up one by one, with
a quill cut in the shape of a scoop, and place them in another
glass with clean water; if they cling to the quill, let it remain
a minute or two in the water, and they will soon disengage
themselves.</p>

<p>They are preserved best in large glasses that hold three or four
quarts of water; for in a glass of this size the water need not be
renewed so often, particularly, if the f&aelig;ces are taken out from
time to time with the feathered end of a pen, to which they readily
adhere; and further, the trouble of feeding each individual
is in some measure saved, as you need only throw in a parcel of
worms, and let the polypes divide them for themselves.</p>

<p>To observe with accuracy the various habitudes, positions, &amp;c.
of this little animal, it will be necessary to place some of them in
narrow cylindrical glasses; then, by means of the microscope,
Fig. 3. <a href="#Plate6">Plate VI.</a> you may observe them exerting all their actions
of life with ease and convenience; the facility with which the lens
of the fore-mentioned microscope may be moved and placed in
any direction, renders it a most convenient instrument for examining
any object that requires to be viewed in water.</p>

<p>It is also very proper to dry some of them, and place them between
talcs in a slider; this, however requires some dexterity and
a little practice; though, when executed with success, it fully rewards
the pains of the observer. Choose a proper polype, and put
it into a small concave lens, with a drop of water; when it is
extended, and the tail fixed, pour off a little of the water, and
then plunge it with the concave into some spirit of wine contained
in the bowl of a large spoon; by this it is instantly killed, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page158">[158]</span>
arms and body contracting more or less; rub it gently while in the
spirit with a small hair pencil, to cleanse it from the lice.</p>

<p>The difficulty now begins; for the parts of the polype, on being
taken out of the spirit, immediately cling together, so that it is
not practicable to extend the body, and separate the arms on the
talc, without tearing them to pieces; therefore the only method
is, to adjust them upon the talc while in the spirit: this may be
done by slipping the talc under the body of the polype, while it
lies in the spirit, and displaying its arms thereon by the small
hair pencil and a pair of nippers; then lift the talc, with the polype
upon it, out of the spirit; take hold of it with the nippers in
the left hand, dip the pencil in the spirit with the right hand, and
therewith dispose of the several parts, that they may lie in a convenient
manner, at the same time brushing away any lice that
may be seen upon the talc; now let it dry, which it does in a little
time, and place the talc carefully in the hole of the slider. To
prevent the upper talc and ring pressing on the polype, you must
cut three pieces of cork, about the bigness of a pin&#8217;s head, and the
depth of the polype, and fix them by gum in a triangular position,
partly on the edges of the said talc, and partly to the sides
of the ivory hole itself; the upper talc may then be laid on these
corks, and pressed down by the ring as usual.<a href="#Footnote45" id="FNanchor45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<h4>OF VEGETABLES.</h4>

<p>It were to be wished a satisfactory account could here be given
of all the preparations which are requisite to fit for the microscope
the objects of the vegetable kingdom. Dr. Hill is the only writer
who has handled this subject. I shall, therefore, extract from his<span class="pagenum" id="Page159">[159]</span>
&#8220;Treatise on the Construction of Timber,&#8221; what he has said;
this, together with the improvements I have made on the cutting
engine, will enable the reader to pursue the subject and extend
it further, both for his own pleasure, and the advantage of the
public.</p>

<h5>THE MANNER OF OBTAINING THE PARTS OF A SHOOT
SEPARATE.</h5>

<p>In the beginning of April, take a quantity of young branches
from the scarlet oak, and other trees. These are first cut into
lengths, of the growth of different seasons; and then part is left
entire, part split, and the rest quartered. In this state they are
put into a wicker basket, with large openings, or of loose work,
and a heavy stone is put in with them; a rope is tied to the handle
of the basket, and it is thrown into a brook of running water:
at times it is taken up, and exposed a little to the air; it is frequently
shook about under water, to wash off filth; and once in
ten days the sticks are examined.</p>

<p>By degrees the parts loosen from one another, and by gentle
rubbing in a bason of water just warmed, they will be so far
separated, that a pencil brush will perfect the business, and afford
pieces of various sizes, pure, distinct, and clean. One part will
in this way separate at one time, and another, at another; but
by turning the sticks to the water, and repeating the operation,
in the course of four or five weeks every part may be obtained
distinct. They are best examined immediately; but if any one
wish to preserve them for repeated inquiries, it may be done in
this manner: dissolve half an ounce of alum in two quarts of
water; drop the pieces thus separated, for a few moments, into
this solution, then dry them upon paper, and put them up in
vials of spirit of wine, no other fluid being so well adapted to
preserve these tender bodies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page160">[160]</span></p>

<h5>TO PREPARE THE RIND FOR OBSERVATION.</h5>

<p>As the vessels of the rind are of different diameters in various
trees, though their construction and that of the blebs is perfectly
the same in all, it will be best to choose for this purpose the rind
of a tree wherein they are largest. The rind of the ash-leaved
maple is finely suited. A piece of this may be obtained of two
inches long, and will very successfully answer the intention.
Such a piece being prepared without alum or spirit, but dried
from the water in which it had been macerated, it is to be impregnated
with lead in the following manner, to shew the apertures
by their colour.</p>

<p>Dissolve one drachm of sugar of lead in an ounce and an half
of water; filter this through paper, and pour it into a tea-cup.
Clip off a thin slice of what was the lower end of the piece of
rind as it grew on the tree, and plunge it near an inch deep into
the liquor; keep it upright between two pieces of stick, so that
one half or more may be above the water; whelm a wine-and-water
glass over the tea-cup, and set the whole in a warm place.
When it has stood two days, take it out, clip off all that part
which was in the liquor, and throw it away.</p>

<p>The circumstances here mentioned, trivial as they may seem,
must be attended to: the operation will not succeed, even if the
covering-glass be omitted; it keeps a moist atmosphere about the
rind, and makes its vessels supple.</p>

<p>While this is standing, put into a bason two ounces of quick
lime, and an ounce of orpiment; pour upon them a pint and an
half of boiling water; stir the whole together, and when it has
stood a day and a night, it will be fit for use. This is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page161">[161]</span>
&#8220;liquor probatorius vini&#8221; of some of the German chymists; it
discovers lead when wines are adulterated with it, and will shew
it any where.</p>

<p>Put a little of this liquor in a tea-cup, and plunge the piece of
rind half way into it.</p>

<p>In the former part of this experiment, the vessels of the rind
have been filled with a solution of lead, that makes of itself no
visible alteration in them; but this colourless impregnation, when
the orpiment lixivium gets to it, becomes of a deep brown; the
vessels themselves appear somewhat the darker for it; but these
dots, which are real openings, are now plainly seen to be such,
the colour being perfectly visible in them, and much darker than
in the vessels. This object must be always viewed dry.</p>

<p>If a piece of the rind, thus impregnated, be gently rubbed between
the fingers, till the parts are separated, we shall be able in
one place or other, to get a view of the vessels all round, and of
the films which form the blebs between them.</p>

<p>Every part of the rind, and every coat of it, even the interstitial
place between its innermost coat and bark, are filled with a fine
fluid. The very course and progress of the fluid may be shewn
in this part, even by an easy preparation; only that different
rinds must be sought for this purpose, the vessels in some being
larger than in others. Repeated trials have shewn me that the
whole progress may be easily marked in the three following kinds,
with only a tincture of cochineal.</p>

<p>Put half an ounce of cochineal, in powder, into half a pint of
spirit of wine; set it in a warm place, and shake it often for four
days; then filter off the clear tincture. Put an inch depth of<span class="pagenum" id="Page162">[162]</span>
this into a cup, and set upright in it pieces of the rind of ash,
white willow, and ozier, prepared as has been directed, by maceration
in water; for in that way one trouble serves for an hundred
kinds. Let an inch of the rinds also stand up out of the tincture.
After twenty-four hours take them out, clip off the part which
was immersed in the fluid, and save the rest for observation.</p>

<h5>TO PREPARE THE BLEA.</h5>

<p>Cut the pieces in a fit season, either just before the first leaves
of Spring, or in the Midsummer shooting time. Then we see all
the wonders of the structure; the thousands of mouths which
open throughout the course of these innumerable vessels, to pour
their fluid into the interstitial matter.</p>

<p>These vessels, which are in nature cisterns of sap for the feeding
the growth of the whole tree, are so large, that they are capable
of being filled with coloured wax, in the manner of the
vessels in anatomical injections; and this way they present pleasing
objects for the microscope, and afford excellent opportunities of
tracing their course and structure.</p>

<h5>A METHOD OF FILLING THE SAP VESSELS OF PLANTS.</h5>

<p>A great many shoots of the scarlet and other oaks are to be
taken off in the Spring; they must be cut into pieces of about
two inches in length, and immediately from the cutting they
must drop into some warm rain water: in this they are to stand
twenty-four hours, and then be boiled a little. When taken out,
they are to be tied on strings, and hung up in a place where the
air passes freely, but the sun does not shine. When they are
perfectly dry, a large quantity of green wax, such as is used for
the seals of law deeds, is to be gently melted in an earthen pipkin<span class="pagenum" id="Page163">[163]</span>
set in water; the water to be heated and kept boiling. As soon
as the wax runs, the sticks are to be put in, and they are frequently
to be stirred about. They must be kept in this state
about an hour, and then the pipkin is to be taken out of the water,
and set upon a naked fire, where it is to be kept with the
wax boiling for two or three hours; fresh supplies of the same
wax being added from time to time.</p>

<p>After this it is to be removed from the fire, and the sticks immediately
taken out with a pair of nippers; when they are cold,
the rough wax about them is to be broken off. Both ends of each
stick are to be cut off half an inch long, and thrown away, and
the middle pieces saved. These are then to be cut in smaller
lengths, smoothed at the ends with a fine chissel, and many of
them split in various thicknesses.</p>

<p>Thus are obtained preparations, not only of great use, but of
wonderful beauty. Many trees this way afford handsome objects
as well as the oak; and in some, where the sap vessels are few,
large, and distinct, the split pieces resemble striped satins, in a
way scarce to be credited. It is in such that the outer coats of
these vessels are most happily of all to be examined.</p>

<h4>THE METHOD OF PREPARING SALTS AND SALINE SUBSTANCES,
FOR THE VIEWING THEIR CONFIGURATIONS.</h4>

<p>Dissolve the subject to be examined in no larger a quantity of
river or rain water than is sufficient to saturate it; if it be a body
easily dissoluble, make use of cold water, otherwise make the
water warm or hot, or even boiling, according as you find it necessary.
After it is perfectly dissolved, let it rest for some hours,
till, if over-charged, the redundant saline particles are precipitated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page164">[164]</span>
and settle at the bottom, or shoot into crystals; by which
means you are most likely to have a solution of the same strength
at one time as at another; that is, a solution fully charged with
as much as it can hold up, and no more; and by these precautions
the configurations appear alike, how often soever tried: whereas,
if the water be less saturated, the proportions, at different times,
will be subject to more uncertainty; and if it be examined before
such separation and precipitation of the redundant salts, little
more will be seen than a confused mass of crystals.</p>

<p>The solution being thus prepared, take up a drop of it with a
goose quill, cut in fashion of a scoop, and place it on a flat slip of
glass, of about three quarters of an inch in width, and between
three and four inches long, spreading it on the glass with the
quill, in either a round or oval figure, till it appears a quarter of
an inch or more in diameter, and so shallow as to rise very little
above the surface of the glass. When it is so disposed, hold it
as level as you can over the clear part of a fire that is not too
fierce, or over the flame of a candle, at a distance proportionable
to the degree of heat it requires, which experience only can direct,
and watch it very carefully till you discover the saline particles
beginning to gather and look white, or of some other colour,
at the extremities of the edges; then having adjusted the microscope
before-hand for its reception, armed with the fourth glass,
which is the fittest for most of these experiments, place it under
your eye, and bring it exactly to the focus of the magnifier; and
after running over the whole drop, fix your attention on that side
where you observe any increase or pushing forwards of crystalline
matter from the circumference towards the center.</p>

<p>This motion is extremely slow at the beginning, unless the
drop has been over-heated, but quickens as the water evaporates,<span class="pagenum" id="Page165">[165]</span>
and in many kinds, towards the conclusion, produces configurations
with a swiftness inconceivable, composed of an infinity of
parts, which are adjusted to each other with an elegance, regularity,
and order, beyond what the exactest pencil in the world,
guided by the ruler and compass, can ever equal, or the most
luxurious imagination fancy.</p>

<p>When action once begins, the eye cannot be taken off, even
for a moment, without losing something worth observation; for
the figures alter every instant, till the whole process is over; and
in many sorts, after all seems at an end, new forms arise, different
entirely from any that appeared before, and which probably are
owing to some small quantity of salt of another kind, which the
other separates from, and leaves to act after itself has done; and
in some subjects three or four different sorts are observable, few
or none being simple and homogeneous.</p>

<p>When the configurations are fully formed, and all the water
evaporated, most kinds of them are soon destroyed again by the
moisture or action of the air upon them; their points and angles
lose their sharpness, become uneven and defaced, and moulder as
it were away; but some few are permanent, and by being inclosed
between glasses, they may be preserved months or even
years.</p>

<p>It happens oftentimes that a drop of a saline solution can
hardly be spread on the slip of glass, by reason of the glass&#8217;s
smoothness, but breaks into little globules, as it would do were
the surface greasy: the way to prevent this is, by rubbing the
broken drop with your finger over the glass, so as to leave the
glass smeared with it; on which smeared place, when dry, another
drop of the solution may be spread very easily in whatever
form is agreeable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page166">[166]</span></p>

<p>It sometimes happens, that when a heated drop is placed properly
for examination, the observer finds such a cloudiness that
he can distinguish nothing of the object; which is owing to saline
steams that arise from the drop, covering and obscuring the object
glass, and therefore must immediately be wiped away with a soft
cloth or leather.</p>

<p>In all examinations of saline solutions by the microscope, even
though made in the day-time, you must use a candle; for the
configurations, being exceedingly transparent, are rendered much
more distinguishable by the brown light a candle affords, than by
the more white and transparent day-light; and besides, either by
moving the candle, or turning the microscope, such light may be
varied or directed just as the subject requires.</p>

<p>It may be also proper to take notice, that no kinds of microscopes
are fit for these observations, but such as have an open
stage, whereon the slips of glass, with the liquor upon them, may
be placed readily, and in a perfect horizontal position; and moreover,
where they can be turned about freely, and without disordering
the fluid.</p>

<h2><span class="chapno">CHAP. V.</span><br />
<span class="chapname">THE IMPORTANCE OF NATURAL HISTORY; OF INSECTS IN
GENERAL, AND OF THEIR CONSTITUENT PARTS.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="startcapital">T</span>here is no human science which to a rational mind exhibits
a greater variety of attractions, or which is more deserving of
general esteem, than that of <span class="smcapall">NATURAL HISTORY</span>; accordingly we
find, that from the earliest times in which the sciences have been
promulgated, it has never been entirely destitute of its votaries;
but, on the contrary, has for ages employed the lives of many
learned men, as being, in fact, the study of <span class="smcapall">DIVINE WISDOM</span>
displayed in the creation: the farther our researches are carried,
the more striking proofs of it every where abound. In the present
century, an &aelig;ra particularly devoted to investigation, and
propitious to discovery and improvement in various branches of
science, Natural History, so far from being neglected, has been
more generally cultivated, and pursued with an ardor unprecedented
at any former period. Men of the first rank in literature
have become indefatigable labourers in the vast and unbounded
field which it presents to the eyes of an accurate and attentive
observer. The animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms,
have been examined with the utmost care; that confusion and
perplexity which seemed unavoidably to result from a view
of the immense variety of articles contained in each of those departments,<span class="pagenum" id="Page168">[168]</span>
and which frequently deterred persons from engaging
in the pursuit, have been in a great measure removed by the introduction
of systematic arrangement; by these means, the various
subjects are distributed into classes and genera, enabling us
to form distinct and comprehensive ideas of them. To the same
methodical plan, and the nicety of discrimination thence arising,
we must attribute the discovery and description of many new
species; this has excited an emulation still farther to pursue the
inquiry, nor need any apprehension be entertained that the subject
will be exhausted, as, no doubt, an infinite variety still remains
unexplored to engage the utmost attention of the philosophic
mind, and fully to compensate the pains bestowed on so
interesting a branch of knowledge.</p>

<p>Of the abundance of articles enumerated in books of Natural
History, there are comparatively few, whose uses are as yet
known, or their properties fully understood. The true naturalist
should always bear in mind that there is a vast difference between
retaining the names, and investigating the nature and peculiar
qualities of the creatures to which they belong. It is highly proper,
indeed necessary, that the multifarious objects of Natural
History should be well ascertained and distinguished with nicety
in all their varieties; the science and admirers of it are, therefore,
unquestionably indebted to the able naturalists who have devoted
their time, and exercised their ingenuity in devising commodious
methods of arrangement, and invented systems for identifying
the several subjects with accuracy, and less danger of fallacy or
mistake: but all who are, or would wish to be thought naturalists,
ought to consider, that the best possible mode of classification is,
after all, but an introduction to Natural History. The ingenious
and indefatigable <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>, who spent his life in fabricating the
curious system now generally adopted, intended it certainly for
the improvement of the science, as a basis for the service of knowledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page169">[169]</span>
and the benefit of mankind; let us be cautious not to mistake
the means for the end, but in the prosecution of the science,
think of the true ends of knowledge, and endeavour to promote
our own instruction, and the advancement of others, with a view
to the adoration of that <span class="smcapall">DIVINE BEING</span> to whom all creation is
indebted for existence, and their application to the occasions and
uses of life, all along conducting and perfecting the study in the
spirit of benevolence.</p>

<p>The study of nature, or in other words, a serious contemplation
of the works of <span class="smcapall">GOD</span>, is indeed a great and proper object for
the exercise of our rational faculties; nor can we perhaps employ
them better, than in endeavouring to make ourselves acquainted
with the works of that glorious Being from whom they were
received.</p>

<p>Though there is a great deal of pleasure in contemplating the
material world, or that system of bodies into which the <span class="smcapall">DIVINE
ARCHITECT</span> has so admirably wrought the mass of dead matter,
with the several relations which those bodies bear to one another;
there is still something more wonderful and surprizing arising
from the contemplation of the animated world; by which is to
be understood all those animals with which every part of the
universe is furnished. The material world is only the shell of
the universe; the animated world are its inhabitants.</p>

<p>Existence is a blessing to those beings only which are endowed
with perception, and appears useless when bestowed upon dead
matter, any farther than as it is subservient to beings which are
conscious of their existence. Thus we find, from the bodies which
lie under our observation, that matter is only made as the basis
and support of animals, and that there is no more of the one than
what is necessary for the exigence of the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page170">[170]</span></p>

<p>There are some living creatures which are raised but just above
dead matter; there are many others, but one remove from these,
which have no other senses but those of feeling and taste; others
have still an additional sense of hearing; others of smell, and
again others of sight. It is wonderful to observe, by what a gradual
progress life advances through a prodigious variety of species,
before a creature is formed that possesses all these senses; and
even among these, there is such a different degree of perfection
in the senses which one animal enjoys beyond what appears in
another, that, though the sense in different animals be distinguished
by the same common denomination, it seems almost of a
different nature. If, after this, we look into the several inward
qualities of sagacity, or what is generally called instinct, we find
them rising after the same manner imperceptibly one above another,
and receiving additional improvements, according to the
species in which they are implanted. This progress in nature is
so very gradual, that what appears to us the most perfect of an
inferior species, comes very near to the most imperfect, as we are
accustomed to call it, of that which is immediately above it.</p>

<p>The exuberant and overflowing goodness of the <span class="smcapall">SUPREME
BEING</span>, whose mercy extends to all his works, is plainly seen, as
before observed, from his having made so very little matter, at
least what falls within our knowledge, that does not swarm with
life; nor is his goodness less visible in the diversity than in the
multitude of living creatures. Had he only made one species of
animals, none else could have enjoyed the happiness of existence;
he has, therefore, included in his creation, every degree of life,
every capacity of being. The whole chasm of nature, from a
plant to a man, is filled up with diverse kinds of creatures, rising
one above another, by such a gentle and easy ascent, that the
little transitions and deviations from one species to the other are
almost insensible. This intermediate space is so prudently managed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page171">[171]</span>
that there is scarce a degree of perception which does not
appear in some one part of the animated world. Is the goodness
or the wisdom of the <span class="smcapall">DIVINE BEING</span> more manifest in this
his proceeding?</p>

<p>In this system of creation there is no creature so wonderful in
its nature, and which so much merits our particular attention, as
man, who fills up the middle space between the animal and intellectual
nature, the visible and invisible world; and is that link,
in the chain of beings, which has been often termed the &#8220;nexus
utriusque mundi.&#8221; So that he, who in one respect being associated
with angels and arch-angels, may look upon a <span class="smcapall">BEING</span> of
infinite perfection as his father, and the highest order of spirits
as his brethren, may, in another respect, say to corruption, &#8220;Thou
art my father, and to the worm, thou art my mother and my
sister.&#8221;<a href="#Footnote46" id="FNanchor46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote46"><a href="#FNanchor46" class="label">[46]</a> Spectator, Vol. vii. Numb. 519.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>There are, however, many who form their judgments of the
works of nature from external appearance only; hence they imagine,
that the greatest and most magnificent are the only perfect
parts of creation, and worthy of our regard. Hence they confine
their attention to the more splendid and shining branches of philosophy,
and are too apt to treat the other parts with coolness
and indifference, not to say contempt.</p>

<p>But surely a true philosopher is one who diligently pursues the
study of nature in all its branches; who can behold with admiration
her noblest productions, yet view with pleasure the smallest
of her works: in short, one who thinks every thing excellent
that owes its formation to the <span class="smcapall">GOD</span> of nature; and we need only
take a transient view of the smaller creatures with which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page172">[172]</span>
earth is peopled, to discover that they are perfect in their kind,
and carry about them as strong marks of infinite wisdom, power,
and beneficence as the greatest. It has been justly said, &#8220;that
there is not a vegetable that grows, nor an insect that moves, but
what is sufficient to confound the Atheist, and to afford the candid
observer endless materials for devout adoration and praise.&#8221;</p>

<p>If we examine insects with attention, we shall soon be convinced
of their divine origin, and survey with admiration the
wonderful art and mechanism of their structure, wherein such a
number of vessels, parts, and movements are collected in a single
point; yet are they furnished with weapons to seize their prey,
dexterity to escape their foes, every thing requisite to perform
the business of their stations, and enjoy the pleasures of their
conditions. What a profusion of the richest ornaments and the
gayest colours are often bestowed on one little insect! and yet
there are thousands of others that are as beautiful and wonderful
in their kind; some are covered with shining coats of mail, others
are adorned with plumes of feathers, all of them furnished with
every thing that is proper to make them answer the purposes for
which they were designed.</p>

<p>&#8220;After an attentive examination of the nature and fabric of
both the least and largest animals, I cannot,&#8221; says the great and
excellent Swammerdam, &#8220;but allow the less an equal, perhaps a
superior degree of dignity; whoever duly considers the conduct
and instinct of the one, with the manners and actions of the
other, must acknowledge, that they are all under the direction
and controul of a supreme and particular intelligence; which, as
in the largest it extends beyond the limits of our comprehension,
escapes our researches in the smallest. If, while we dissect with
care the larger animals, we are filled with wonder at the elegant
disposition of their limbs, the inimitable order of their muscles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page173">[173]</span>
and the regular direction of their veins, arteries, and nerves, to
what an height is our astonishment raised, when we discover all
the parts arranged in the least, and in the same regular manner!
How is it possible but we must stand amazed when we reflect,
that those little animals, whose bodies are smaller than the point
of the dissecting knife, have muscles, veins, arteries, and every
other part common to the larger animals? Creatures so very diminutive,
that our hands are not delicate enough to manage, or
our eyes sufficiently acute to see them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The subserviency of the several beings in the visible creation to
one another; the order in which each of them appears in that
appointed season, when only it can be conducive to the purposes
of the rest; and the preservation of a sufficient number of every
species, amidst the immense havoc that reigns throughout, are,
among other things, proofs of the amazing and incomprehensible
wisdom by which they were all formed. With what pleasure
does the mind, accustomed to look up from effects to their
causes, from created beings to the <span class="smcapall">GREAT SOURCE OF BEING</span>,
view that unbounded beneficence, which leaves not the smallest
space, capable of supporting existence of any kind, unplanted
with them. There is hardly any portion of matter, or the least
drop of fluid naturally found on the surface of the earth, that is
not inhabited by multitudes of animals; the subterraneous regions
are peopled with their minute inhabitants, and the abyss of the
sea, where no human eye can penetrate, abounds with animated
beings.</p>

<p>The air is usually considered as the great source of destruction
to bodies, whether animal or vegetable; but we do not always
understand by what means or in what manner it is performed.
What we term destruction and decay of one substance, occasions<span class="pagenum" id="Page174">[174]</span>
the production and ripening a multitude of others; wherever the
air is admitted, with it a thousand different things find their way;
and what is usually attributed to the effects of that fluid, is in
general occasioned by the multitudes of bodies with which it is
fraught. Redi observed, that flesh preserved from the access of
flies, would bread no maggots; and it is as constant an observation,
that vegetable substances will keep a long time in whatever
state they are, if the air be excluded; but as soon as it is
admitted, they also produce or afford their several kinds either of
animal, or minuter vegetable inhabitants. In the first of these
cases, the parent flies make their way to the exposed flesh, and
there deposit their eggs for the production of a new offspring; in
the other, multitudes of the seeds of minute plants and ovula of
animals are floating in the air, and accompany it wherever it enters;
if they be thus deposited in a place proper for vegetation
and accretion, they burst their inclosures, and attain their growth
as regularly as the seeds of plants deposited in the earth, or the
eggs of larger animals in the nest.</p>

<p>The same wisdom which placed the sun in the center of the
system, and arranged the several planets around him in their
order, has no less shewn itself in the provision made for the
food and dwelling of every bird that roams in the air, and every
beast that wanders in the desert; equally great in the smallest
and in the most magnificent objects; in the star and in the insect;
in the elephant and in the fly; in the beam that shines from
heaven and in the grass that cloathes the ground. Nothing is
overlooked, nothing is carelessly performed: every thing that exists
is adapted with perfect symmetry to the end for which it was
designed. This wisdom displayed by the Almighty in the creation,
was not intended merely to gratify curiosity and to raise
wonder; it ought to beget profound submission, and pious trust
in every heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page175">[175]</span></p>

<p>Histories of the providence and caution, the care and foresight
of the most inconsiderable among animal beings, must surely
ever be read with pleasure and attention, as conveying a most
beautiful lesson to a reflecting mind; it is impossible for any one
thus instructed to think that the Great Being, who has been
so careful of those inferior creatures, can be regardless of him
whom he has placed in a station infinitely more exalted. Throughout
the whole system of things, we behold a manifest tendency
to promote the benefit either of the rational or the animal creation.
In some parts of nature, this tendency may be less obvious
than in others. Objects, which to us seem useless or hurtful,
may sometimes occur; and strange it were, if in so vast and
complicated a system, difficulties of this kind should not occasionally
present themselves to beings, whose views are so narrow
and limited as ours. It is well known, that in proportion as the
knowledge of nature has increased among men, these difficulties
have diminished. Satisfactory accounts have been given of many
perplexing appearances; useful and proper purposes have been
found to be promoted by objects which were at first thought to
be unprofitable or noxious.<a href="#Footnote47" id="FNanchor47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote47"><a href="#FNanchor47" class="label">[47]</a> The great beauty
of the dye produced by the cochineal insect, and the medical virtues of
the cantharis, have occasioned them to be considered as very extensive and valuable articles of
commerce. The benefits derived from the bee and the silk-worm are universally known; and
spiders, could a method be devised to induce them to live in harmony, might also be productive
of very essential advantages to the human race. <span class="smcap">Edit.</span></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Malignant must be the mind of that person; with a distorted
eye he must have contemplated creation, who can suspect that it
is not the production of infinite benignity and goodness. How
many clear marks of benevolent intention appear every where
around us? What a profusion of beauty and ornament is poured
forth on the face of nature? What a magnificent spectacle presented
to the view of man? What a supply contrived for his<span class="pagenum" id="Page176">[176]</span>
wants? What a variety of objects set before him, to gratify his
senses, to employ his understanding, to entertain his imagination,
to cheer and gladden his heart? Indeed the very existence of the
universe is a standing memorial of the goodness of the Creator;
for nothing except goodness could originally prompt creation.
No new accession of felicity or glory was to result to him from
creatures whom he made: it was goodness communicating and
pouring itself forth, goodness delighting to impart happiness in
all its forms, which in the beginning created the heaven and the
earth. Hence those innumerable orders of living creatures with
which the earth is peopled, from the lowest class of sensitive
being to the highest rank of reason and intelligence. Wherever
there is life, there is some degree of happiness; there are enjoyments
suited to the different powers of feeling; and earth, air,
and water, are with magnificent liberality made to teem with
life.<a href="#Footnote48" id="FNanchor48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote48"><a href="#FNanchor48" class="label">[48]</a> Blair&#8217;s Sermons.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Let us not then slight, or deem that unworthy our notice, in
which immensity is so conspicuous; or that trivial, in which
there is such a manifestation of infinite beneficence; but rather
let those striking displays of creating goodness call forth, on our
part, responsive love, gratitude, and veneration. To this Great
Father of all existence and life, to Him who hath raised us up to
behold the light of day, and to enjoy all the comforts which his
world presents, let our hearts send forth a perpetual hymn of
praise. Evening and morning let us celebrate Him who maketh
the morning and the evening to rejoice over our heads; who
&#8220;openeth his hand and satisfieth the desire of every living thing.&#8221;
Let us rejoice that we are brought into a world, which is the
production of infinite goodness; over which a supreme intelligence
presides; and where nothing happens but by his divine<span class="pagenum" id="Page177">[177]</span>
permission for the wisest purposes. Convinced that he hateth
not the works which he hath made, nor hath brought creatures
into existence merely to suffer unnecessary pain, let us even in the
midst of sorrow, receive with calm submission whatever he is
pleased to send; thankful for what he bestows; and satisfied that,
without good reason, he takes nothing away.</p>

<p>Such, in general, are the effects which meditation on the
works of the creation ought to produce. It presents such an
astonishing conjunction of power, wisdom, and goodness, as we
cannot behold without religious veneration.</p>

<p>In short, the world around us is the mighty volume wherein
god hath declared himself; a picture wherein his perfections are
displayed. The book of nature is written in a character that
every one may read; it consists not of words, but things; it is a
school where <span class="smcapall">GOD</span> is the teacher. All the objects of sense are as
the letters of an universal language, in which all people and
nations have a common interest; the Creator himself has made
this use of it, revealing his will by it, and referring man to it for
instruction. Hence the universal agreement between nature and
revelation; hence, also, he that can understand <span class="smcapall">GOD</span> as the Fountain
of truth and the Saviour of men in the holy scriptures, will
be better enabled to understand and adore him as the fountain
of power and goodness in the natural creation. Thus will philosophy
and divinity go hand in hand, and shew that the world
was made, as the scriptures were written, for our instruction;
and that the creation of <span class="smcapall">GOD</span> is a school for Christians, if they
use it aright.<a href="#Footnote49" id="FNanchor49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote49"><a href="#FNanchor49" class="label">[49]</a> It is a curious,
though melancholy subject of contemplation, to observe how different have
been the sentiments of learned and reputedly pious men in times less enlightened; a period
when attention to, or compassion for, the animal creation could find no place in a breast that
withheld and denied the mercy of God unto men; when mercy itself was deemed heresy! Even
in prior and purer times it was affirmed that &#8220;It is absurd, and a disparagement to the majesty
of <span class="smcapall">GOD</span> to suppose him to know how many insects there are in the world, or how many fishes in
the sea; yea, that such an idea of the Omniscience of <span class="smcapall">GOD</span> would be foolish flattery to Him,
and an injury to ourselves.&#8221; For the satisfaction of the learned reader, I shall here quote the

<h3>A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF INSECTS.</h3>

<p>The subjects of that part of the creation we are now going to
survey, merit our attention as exceeding the rest of animated nature
in their numbers, the singularity of their appearance, and
the variety of their forms. Earth, air, and water are filled with
hosts of them. Being for the major part very small, and myriads
so diminutive, as even to be imperceptible to the unassisted eye,
our knowledge of them, and their component parts would be
extremely circumscribed and imperfect, were it not for the advantages
derived from the use of the microscope; but happily
possessed of this valuable instrument, an inexhaustible source of
entertainment and instruction is afforded to the curious inquirer
into the wonders of nature. The beauties of the minuter parts
of creation are not more hidden from our unassisted sight, than
the ends and purposes of their &#339;conomy from slight and superficial
observation; the microscope does not more amaze and charm
as with a discovery of the first, than the application of our faculties
in investigating the latter.</p>

<p>The name of <span class="smcapall">INSECT</span> has been appropriated to these small animals
on account of the sections or divisions that are observable in
the bodies of the greatest part of them; though, perhaps, it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page179">[179]</span>
impossible to find any precise term that shall embrace the whole
genera, as many particulars must be described before we can
attain an exact notion of these animals and their structure.</p>

<p>An insect is now generally defined to be, an animated being
whose head is furnished with antenn&aelig;; that is destitute of bones,
but which, instead thereof, is covered with a very hard skin;
that has six or more feet; and that breathes through spiracula, or
pores placed in the side of the body.</p>

<p>To be more particular, quadrupeds, birds, and fishes have an
internal skeleton of bones, to which the muscles are affixed; but
the whole interior body of insects is composed of soft flesh, and
the muscles are attached to an external skeleton, serving the
double purpose of skin and bone.</p>

<p>Insects are by most writers considered as divided into four
principal parts: the caput, or head; the thorax, or trunk; the
abdomen, or belly; and artus, or limbs. A perfect knowledge of
these parts, and their several subdivisions, is requisite for those
who are desirous of forming accurate ideas of these minute animals,
or who wish to arrange them in their proper classes.</p>

<p>The head is affixed to the thorax by a species of articulation
or joint; it is the principal seat of the senses, and contains the
rudiments of the brain;<a href="#Footnote50" id="FNanchor50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> it is furnished with a mouth, eyes, antenn&aelig;,
a forehead, a throat, and stemmata. In the greater part
of insects the head is distinctly divided from the thorax, but in
others it coalesces with it. The head of some insects is very
large compared with the size of their bodies; the proportion between
the head of the same insect is not always similar; in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page180">[180]</span>
caterpillars with horny heads it is generally small, before they
moult or change their skin, but much larger after each moulting.
The hardness of the exterior part of the head prevents its growth
before the change; it is, consequently, in proportion to the body
very small; but when the insect is disposing itself for the change,
the internal substance of the head retires inwards to the first ring
of the neck, where it has room to expand itself; so that when
the animal quits the skin, we are surprized with a head twice the
former size; and, as the insect neither eats nor grows while the
head is forming, there is this further circumstance to be remarked,
that the body and the head have each their particular time of
growth: while the head expands and grows, the body does not
grow at all; when the body increases, the head remains of the
same size, without any change. The heads of all kinds of insects,
and their several parts, form very pleasing, as well as most
diversified objects for the opake microscope.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Os, the mouth, is a part of the insect to which the naturalist
will find it necessary to pay a very particular attention; Fabricius
goes so far as to assert that, without a thorough knowledge of the
mouth, its form, and various appendages, it will be impossible
ever to discriminate with accuracy one insect from another. In
the structure of the mouth considerable art and wisdom is displayed;
the diversity of the figure is almost as great as the variety
of species. It is usually placed in the forepart of the head, extending
somewhat downwards; in the chermes, coccus, and some
other insects, it is placed under the breast. In some insects, the
mouth is forcipated, to catch, hold, and tear the prey; in others,
aculeated, to pierce and wound animals, and suck their blood;
in others, strongly ridged with jaws and teeth, to gnaw and
scrape out their food, carry burdens, perforate the earth, nay the
hardest wood, and even stones themselves, for habitations and
nests for their young. Others are furnished with a kind of tube<span class="pagenum" id="Page181">[181]</span>
or tongue, at one time moveable, at another fixed; with this
they suck the juices of the flowers: in some again the tongue is
so short, as to appear to us incapable of answering the purpose for
which it was formed, and the oestri appear to have no mouth.</p>

<p>Maxill&aelig;, the jaws, are generally two in number; in some,
four; in others, more. They are sometimes placed in an horizontal,
sometimes in a transverse direction; the inner edge is serrated,
or furnished with small teeth, as in the cicada, nepa,
notonecta, cimex, (bug,) aphis, and remarkably so in some curculeones.</p>

<p>The rostrum, or proboscis, is in general a very curious and
complicated organ; it is the mouth drawn out to a rigid point.
In many insects of the hemiptera class, it is bent down towards
the breast and belly. It has by some writers been considered as
serving at once the different purposes of mouth, nose, and windpipe,
enabling the insect to extract the juices of plants, communicate
the sensation of smelling, and convey air to the body.</p>

<p>Lingua, the tongue, is a taper and compact instrument, by
which the insect obtains the juices of plants. Some can contract
or expand it, others roll it up with dexterity; in some it is inclosed
within a sheath. It is taper and spiral in the butterfly,
tubular and fleshy in the fly; in all affording agreeable amusement
for the microscope. To exemplify which in one or two
instances, while it relieves the reader from the tediousness of
narration, will, it is hoped, animate him to farther researches on
the subject.</p>

<h4>OF THE PROBOSCIS OF THE BEE.</h4>

<p>Every day&#8217;s experience shews that the more we penetrate into
the hidden recesses and internal parts of natural bodies, the more<span class="pagenum" id="Page182">[182]</span>
we find them marked with perfection in form and design; of the
truth of which observation the minute apparatus now to be described
will, no doubt, ensure conviction. Swammerdam, when
speaking thereof, breaks out into this pious and humble confession:
&#8220;I cannot refrain,&#8221; says he, &#8220;from confessing to the glory
of the Immense and Incomprehensible Architect, that I have but
imperfectly described and represented this small organ; for, to
represent it to the life in its full perfection, as truly most perfect
it is, far exceeds the utmost efforts of human knowledge.&#8221;</p>

<p>From what has here been said, it will be easy to perceive, that
the limits of these Essays will not permit our entering largely into
a description of the minute parts of the proboscis of the bee; for
an ample account of which recourse must be had to the works of
Swammerdam and Reaumur. The last writer, like a skilful workman
who takes to pieces a watch which he himself has made,
exhibits to you the several parts of which it is composed, and explains
their fitness, their adjustments, their uses, the play of the
pivots, springs, and pillars; for all these parts, and many more,
are to be found in the proboscis of a bee.</p>

<p>It is by this small instrument that the bee procures the food
necessary for its subsistence. In a general view, it may be considered
as consisting of seven pieces; one of these, i i, b c, Fig. 3.
<a href="#Plate13">Plate XIII.</a> is placed in the middle; this is supposed to be pervious,
and to constitute what may be properly called the tongue;
the other six smaller parts or sheaths, disposed in three pairs, are
placed on each side of the former: they not only assist in extracting
and gathering the honey from the flowers, but they also protect
and strengthen the part. The proboscis itself is very curiously
divided; the divisions are elegant and regular, and are beset
all round with shaggy triangular fibres or villi, distributed in
beautiful order: these divisions, though very numerous, appear<span class="pagenum" id="Page183">[183]</span>
at first sight as a number of different articulations. The tongue,
considered with respect to its length, may be said to have three
articulations; one with the head, then a kind of cylindrical horny
substance, which forms as it were a base for the true tongue,
which is not horny, but soft, fleshy, and pliable.<a href="#Footnote51" id="FNanchor51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote51"><a href="#FNanchor51" class="label">[51]</a> Philos. Trans. for 1792, Part I.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The two pieces a a of the exterior sheath are of a substance
partly between bone and horn, and partly membranaceous; they
are set round with fibres, and are furnished with air vessels,
which are distributed through their whole texture; the upper
ends f f of this sheath appear to be a little bent, but can be
straitened by the bee when they are applied to the proboscis.
At d d are two articulations, by means of which the pieces a a
may be occasionally bent. The joints contribute towards bending
the proboscis downwards, or rather underneath, against the
head. These sheaths, together with two interior ones e e, assist
in defending, covering, and protecting it from injuries; it is also
probable that they promote the descent of the honey, by pressing
the proboscis. The parts k k of this sheath have been called by
some writers the root.</p>

<p>The two parts e e of the interior sheath are placed higher than
those of the exterior one; they originate at g g on the proboscis
itself, and near that part or articulation, by which the bee can
upon occasion bend the proboscis; this sheath, therefore, always
moves with the middle part i i, and is carried forward by it, the
exterior sheath being left behind, because its attachments and origin
are below that of the proboscis. The pieces e e are very similar
in structure to those of a a, only that each of them has on
the upper part three joints, the lower one is much longer than
the other two; they are all of them surrounded with short fibres.<span class="pagenum" id="Page184">[184]</span>
The smaller articulated pieces never lie close to the proboscis, nor
cover it, but are only placed near it, the two upper joints projecting
outwards, as in this figure, even when the whole apparatus
is shut up as much as possible. Swammerdam thinks these
joints are of essential use to the bee, acting as it were in the
manner of fingers, and assisting the proboscis, by opening the
leaves of the flowers, and removing other obstructions from it; or
like the two fore feet of the mole, by the help of which it pushes
the earth from the sides both ways, that it may be able with its
sharp trunk to search for its food more conveniently. There are
two smaller pieces or sheaths, m m, near the bottom of the proboscis;
these cannot be well seen without removing the sheath e e.</p>

<p>The proboscis is partly membranaceous, and partly of a gristly
nature; the lower part is formed in such a manner, that it will
swell out considerably, by which means the internal cavity may
be prodigiously enlarged, and rendered capable of receiving a
very large quantity of native and undigested honey, and larger
than might be expected from its size. When the proboscis is
shut up and inactive, it is very much flattened, and is three or
four times broader than it is thick. The edges are always round;
it grows tapering, though very gradually, towards the extremity.
The lower and membranaceous part of the trunk has no fibres or
villi on it, but is covered with little protuberant transparent
pimples, that are placed in regular order, and at equal distances
from each other, resembling the little risings observable on the
skin of birds when the feathers have been plucked off. They are
probably glandules, and may have a considerable share in changing
or preparing the honey that is swallowed or taken up by the
proboscis. Down the middle of the proboscis there is a tube of a
much harder nature than the sides, it grows gradually smaller towards
the top; at this place the tongue itself is extremely villous,
having some very long villi at the point; whether they are open<span class="pagenum" id="Page185">[185]</span>
tubes, or whether they only serve as so many claws, to keep it in
its proper place while in action, has not been determined; Mr.
John Hunter conceives them to act somewhat like capillary
tubes.</p>

<p>The proboscis terminates in a small cylinder c, at the top of
which there is a little globule or nipple; the bee can contract this
cylindrical part, and the little membrane in which the villi are
fixed, into a much smaller compass, and draw it inwards. The
exterior sheaths lap over each other on the upper part, so that
the outside of the proboscis is protected by a very strong double
case, a covering that was unnecessary for the under part; because
when this instrument is in use the sheaths are opened, but when
it is inactive, it is so folded that the under part is protected by
the body of the bee. Withinside the exterior sheath, and near
the bottom q, are two levers, which are fixed to the end of the
proboscis, and by which it is raised and lowered.</p>

<p>Swammerdam thinks that the honey is, as it were, pumped
or sucked up by the bee through the hole at the end b of the
tongue; he does not seem to have discovered the apertures which
are on the cylindrical part, near the end b. But Reaumur is of
opinion that it is used to lap up the fluid, which is then conveyed
down between the sheath to the mouth of the bee. To ascertain
this, he placed a bee in a glass tube, the inside of which was
rubbed over with honey, and little pieces thereof placed in different
parts; the bee placed the tongue on the honey; stretching
the end beyond the piece thereof, she bent it into the form of a
bow, and inserted the most convex part of the bow into the honey;
by rubbing the glass backwards and forwards with this part,
she soon cleaned that portion to which it was applied, conveying
the honey afterwards to the throat by the vermicular motion of
the tongue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page186">[186]</span></p>

<p>If you attentively observe a bee, when it has placed itself on a
full-blown flower, the activity and address with which it uses
this apparatus will be very conspicuous. It lengthens the end,
and applies it to the bottom of the petals or leaves of the flower,
moving it continually in a vast variety of different directions;
lengthening and shortening, bending and turning it in every possible
way, to adapt it to the form, &amp;c. of the leaves of the flower.
These various movements are executed with a promptitude that
surpasses all description.</p>

<p>The whole of this curious apparatus can be folded up into a
very small compass under the head and neck. The larynx, or
that part next to the head, falls back into the neck, which brings
the extreme end of the first portion of the proboscis within the
upper lip, or behind the two teeth; then the whole of the second
part is bent down upon and under the first part, and the two last
sheaths or scales are also bent down over the whole; so that the
true tongue is inclosed laterally by the two second horny sheaths,
and over the whole lie the two first.</p>

<h4>OF THE PROBOSCIS OF THE BUTTERFLY.</h4>

<p>From the tongue of the bee, let us now direct our attention to
that of the butterfly. This is a spiral substance, somewhat resembling
the spring of a watch when wound up, consisting of
eight rounds; by means of a pin you may gently pull it out to its
full length; it grows gradually tapering from the base, at the
end it divides or separates into two tubes, each furnished with
little organs of suction; probably, it is by these that it extracts
the juices on which it feeds, and not by the extreme ends of the
tongue. As the butterfly has no mouth, the proboscis is the only
alimentary organ; when separated from the insect, it will often<span class="pagenum" id="Page187">[187]</span>
unroll itself, then wind and coil itself up again, continuing these
motions at intervals for a considerable time.</p>

<h4>OF THE PROBOSCIS OF THE CULEX OR GNAT.</h4>

<p>The proboscis of the gnat consists of a great number of extremely
delicate pieces, all concurring to one purpose; this is the
instrument with which it strikes the flesh, and sucks the blood
of animal bodies. The only part exhibited to the naked eye is
the sheath, which contains all the other pieces. This sheath is a
cylindrical tube, which is slit in such a manner, that the insect
can separate it from the dart, and bend it more or less in proportion
as the dart is plunged into the wound. From this tube the
sting is darted, which consists of five or six blades or lancets of
exquisite minuteness, lying one over the other; some of these are
sharpened like a two-edged sword, while others are dentated and
barbed at their extremities like the head of an arrow. The instant
the gnat lances this bundle of darts into the flesh, and penetrates
a vein, a drop or two of fluid is by it insinuated into the
wound, by which the blood is attenuated, and the blades acting
as so many capillary tubes, the blood ascends in them, and is
conveyed into the body of the gnat. The injected fluid also by
its fermentation causes that disagreeable and teazing sensation of
itching, to which most persons are subjected, after having sustained
an attack from one or more of these little animals.<a href="#Footnote52" id="FNanchor52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote52"><a href="#FNanchor52" class="label">[52]</a> To some persons the gnat
(culex pipiens) is so truly formidable, that, during the Summer
season, they constantly dread the approach of evening, that being the time when these blood-thirsty
marauders sally forth in great numbers, pursue them wherever they go, and exempt no
part of the face, hands, or even the legs from their depredations; the consequences of which are,
violent, though happily only local and temporary inflammation, attended with insupportable
itching, succeeded by tumors very similar to those occasioned by a scald; when these have discharged
the pellucid fluid they contain, the symptoms subside. Instances have been known in
the vicinity of London, where for several days the eyes of the sufferers have been closed, the nose
and lips violently swelled, the fingers of both hands so affected as to prevent their motion, and
the legs equally affected. It is remarkable, that in general those who thus suffer are not conscious
of the moment when they receive the injury, but are soon made sensible of it by the effect
it produces. The approach of the enemy is, however, always known by the singing or humming
noise they make; the peculiar note of which, though rendered very familiar by daily repetition,
is never esteemed sufficiently musical to render it pleasant or agreeable to the destined
victims. Amongst the variety of remedies which have been recommended for the cure of this
temporary evil, Barbut mentions the immediate application of volatile alkali, or scratching the
part newly stung, and washing it with cold water; he likewise asserts, that rubbing the part at
night with fuller&#8217;s earth and water abates the inflammation. As preventives are certainly
more acceptable than curatives, I wish I were enabled to recommend such in the present case:
in one instance, the application of vinegar every evening before sun-set produced a happy effect;
possibly washing the parts exposed with extract of saturn properly diluted might prove effectual.</p>

<p>In the Philosophical Transactions for the year 1767, is an account of uncommonly numerous
swarms of gnats which made their appearance at Oxford, during the months of July, August,
and September of the preceding year. So many myriads sometimes occupied the same part of
the atmosphere in contiguous bodies, that they resembled a very black cloud, greatly darkened
the air, and almost totally interrupted the solar rays. The repeated bites of these malignant insects
were so severe, that the legs, arms, heads, and other parts of many persons were swelled to
an enormous size. The colour of the parts was red and fiery, perfectly similar to that of some
of the most alarming inflammations. Some of these gnats had their bodies greatly distended by
the uncommon quantities of blood which they had imbibed.</p>

<p>In short, there is no species of insects more troublesome to mankind than the gnat; others
give more pain with their stings, but it is only when they are attacked, or by accident, that we
are stung by them; but the gnats thirst for our blood, and follow us in whole companies to attack
us. In marshy places of this country the limbs of the inhabitants are kept swelled during
the whole season. In warmer climates, particularly the West Indies, they are, under the denomination
of musquetoes, still more formidable.</p>

<p>Hooke, in his Micrographia, pleads in justification of these terrible little insects, that they do
not wound the skin and suck the blood out of enmity or revenge, but through mere necessity,
and to satisfy their hunger:&mdash;it may be so; and on this account we cannot annex the criminality
to them which appertains to such of the highest rank in the scale of the animal creation, who,
though not urged by the same powerful motive, pursue a somewhat similar conduct; but those
who have experienced their assaults, will scarcely admit this plea as a sufficient apology, or feel
themselves amicably disposed towards them; as, from whatever cause their attacks may proceed,
the effect is so very unpleasant, as almost to justify the sufferers in addressing them in the language
of the frogs in the fable to the boys, &#8220;Consider, I beseech ye, that though this may be
sport to you, it is death to us,&#8221; and ejaculating a wish, that they might be enabled to gratify their
rapacious appetites by some other means. <span class="smcap">Edit.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page188">[188]</span></p>

<h4>OF THE PROBOSCIS OF THE TABANUS OR OX-FLY.</h4>

<p><a href="#Plate16">Plate XVI.</a> Fig. 1. is a microscopic view of the proboscis of a
tabanus, with which it pierces the skins of horses and oxen, and
nourishes itself with their blood; Fig. 2. the same of the natural
size. The singular and compound structure, together with the
wonderful form and exquisite beauty of this apparatus, discovers
such a view of the wisdom, power, and greatness of its infinite
composer, as must strike with admiration every contemplative
observer, and lead him to reflect on the weakness, impotence, and
nothingness of all human mechanism, when compared with the
immense skill and inimitable finishing displayed in the subject
before us. The whole of this formidable apparatus is composed
of six parts, exclusive of the two guards or feelers a a, all of
which are inclosed in a fleshy case, which in the figure is totally
removed, as it contained nothing remarkably different from that<span class="pagenum" id="Page189">[189]</span>
of other insects with two wings. The guards or feelers a a, are
of a spungy or fleshy substance, and are grey, covered with short
hairs or villi; they are united to the head by a little joint of the
same texture, which in this view of the object could not be
shewn. These guards are a defence to the other parts of the apparatus,
as they are laid upon it side by side, whenever the animal
stings, and by that means preserve it from external injury. The
two lancets b b and B, evidently open the wound, and are of a
delicate and tender structure, formed like the dissecting knife of
the anatomist, with a sharp point and slender edge, but gradually
increasing to the back. The two instruments, c c and C, appear
as if intended to enlarge the wound, by irritating the parts round
it; to accomplish which, they are jagged or serrated; they may
also serve, from their hard and horny texture, to defend the tube
e E, which is of a softer nature and tubular to admit the blood,
and convey it to the stomach; this delicate part is inclosed in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page190">[190]</span>
case d D, which entirely covers it. These parts are drawn separately
at B, C, D, E. De Geer observes, that it is only the female
that sucks the blood of animals; and Reaumur declares, that
having made one disgorge itself, the blood it threw up, appeared
to him to be more than the whole body of the insect could have
contained.</p>

<p>Many other instances of the variety and curious fabrication of
this little organ in different insects, may be found in the works
of Reaumur and De Geer; enough has been said to shew that its
mechanism not only eludes the human eye, but far surpasses every
work of man; I shall therefore proceed, in the next place, to
notice</p>

<h4>THE ANTENN&AElig; OF INSECTS.</h4>

<p>The antenn&aelig; are fine slender horns consisting of several articulations,
moveable in various directions, and constituting one of
the discriminating characteristics of insects. They are beautiful
in form, and of a very delicate structure, so finely articulated, and
so minutely jointed, as to be instantaneously moveable in every
direction. They are situated on the fore part of the head.</p>

<p>The shape, the length, the number, and kind of articulations,
not only vary in different species, but the antenn&aelig; of the male
generally differ from those of the female. The greater number
of insects have only two antenn&aelig;, but the oniscus, the pagurus,
and astacus have four. Regular rows of minute holes are said to
have been discovered in the antenn&aelig;. Several insects cover their
eyes with them while they sleep.</p>

<p>We are far from being certain of the use of this organ; some
writers have conjectured that they were the organs of smell and<span class="pagenum" id="Page191">[191]</span>
hearing, others have supposed them appropriated to a delicate
species of feeling, sensible to the least motion or disturbance in
the circumambient fluid in which they move.<a href="#Footnote53" id="FNanchor53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The following
observations throw some light on this obscure subject. When a
wingless insect is placed at the end of a twig, or in any other
situation where it meets with a vacuity, it moves the antenn&aelig;
backward and forward, elevates and depresses them from side to
side, and will not advance further lest it should fall. Place a
stick or any other substance near the antenn&aelig;, and the insect immediately
applies them to this new object, seems to examine
whether it be sufficient to support its weight, and then proceeds
on its journey. From these observations it would appear that the
antenn&aelig; assist the insect in judging of the vicinity of objects, and
probably enable them to walk with safety in the dark.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote53"><a href="#FNanchor53" class="label">[53]</a> Some have thought them
intended to defend the eyes, but though this might seem probable
in regard to the short plumose ones, it can never hold good in those that are slender and
smooth, which can be of no such service. Others have thought them made for wiping and
cleaning the eyes, but for this purpose they are totally unfit; the fore legs of the insect are much
better calculated for this use by the hairs or fibrilla with which they are covered. Possibly they
may be the organs of smelling, since we evidently find that many insects possess this sense in a
very exquisite degree, and yet we see no external organs except these to serve that purpose.
<span class="smcap">Edit.</span></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>That these observations are not, however conclusive, appears
from an experiment of a very ingenious naturalist: being desirous
of ascertaining the nature and use of the antenn&aelig; and proboscis
of a butterfly, he gently approached one that was flying about in
search of food; he observed that it turned the antenn&aelig; about
every way, till coming within scent of a flower, it kept them
fixedly bent toward that object, directing its course by their guidance,
till it arrived at the flower; there they appeared to act
as an organ of smell, and that the minute holes with which it is
furnished assisted in promoting this operation. When the creature
had reached the flower, it hovered over it as with rapture,<span class="pagenum" id="Page192">[192]</span>
poising itself quietly upon its wing, like a kite or hawk in the air;
it then dropped suddenly, till it was on a level with the flower,
when it began to agitate its wings briskly and to unroll its spiral
trunk, thrusting it to the bottom of the flower; in a little time
the trunk was rolled up, and again in a moment unrolled; these
operations it repeated till the flower yielded no more juices, the
butterfly then sought for and alighted on another.<a href="#Footnote54" id="FNanchor54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote54"><a href="#FNanchor54" class="label">[54]</a> After all, this subject must
for the present remain undecided. Indeed, the bodies of insects
are throughout formed of parts so different from ours, that we can probably conceive no more
idea of the use of some of their organs, than a man born blind or deaf can of the senses of vision
or hearing. They may have senses different from ours, and these may be the organs of them.
<span class="smcap">Edit.</span></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The differences in the form, &amp;c. of the antenn&aelig; are characterized
by naturalists under the following names:</p>

<p>Setace&aelig;; are those that, like a bristle, grow gradually taper
towards the point or extremity, as in many of the phalen&aelig;. Filiformes;
thread-shaped, and of an uniform thickness. Moniliformes;
these are filiform like the preceding, and of a regular
thickness, but consist of a series of round knobs, like a necklace
of beads, as in the chrysomela. Clavat&aelig;; formed like a club,
increasing gradually from the base to the extremity, as in the
papilio, butterfly. Capitat&aelig;; these are also formed like a club,
but the last articulation is larger than the rest, finishing with a
kind of capital or head. Fissiles; these are like the former, only
that the capitulum or head is divided longitudinally into three or
four parts or lamin&aelig;, as in the scarab&aelig;i. Perfoliat&aelig;; are also
capitated, but have the capitulum divided horizontally, and the
lamin&aelig; connected by a kind of thread passing through their
center, as in the dermestes and dytiscus. Pectinat&aelig;; so called
from their similitude to a comb, though they more properly resemble
a feather, as in the phalen&aelig; and elateres; this is most<span class="pagenum" id="Page193">[193]</span>
obvious in the male. Aristat&aelig;; such as have a lateral hair, which
is either naked, or furnished with smaller hairs, as in the fly.</p>

<p>Besides the foregoing terms, the antenn&aelig; are called breviores,
or short, when they are shorter than the body; mediocres, or
middling, when they are of the same length; and longiores, when
they are longer.</p>

<p>Near the mouth there is also a species of small filiform articulated
antenn&aelig;, called the palpi, or feelers; they are generally four
in number, sometimes six; they are placed under and at the sides
of the mouth, which situation, together with their size, sufficiently
distinguish them from the antenn&aelig;; they are in continual
motion, the animal thrusting them in every matter, as a hog
would its nose, when in search of food. Some have supposed
them to be a kind of hand to assist in holding the food when it is
near the mouth.</p>

<h4>OF THE EYES OF INSECTS.</h4>

<p>The structure of the eye has always been considered as a wonderful
piece of mechanism; the admirable manner in which those
of the human species are formed, and the nature of vision, are
speculations which cannot but excite the attention of every inquisitive
mind. The eyes of insects, though they differ considerably
in their construction from those of other animals, are no less
objects of our admiration. Indeed, among the exterior parts of
insects, none are more worthy of minute investigation, and very
few persons are to be found, who can be insensible to the beauties
of this organ when exhibited under the microscope, as that instrument
alone points out to us the prodigious art employed in
their organization, and evidently shews how many wonders escape
the unassisted sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page194">[194]</span></p>

<p>The construction of the eye in insects is not only distinct from
that of other animals, but also differs in different species. They
vary in number, situation, connection, and figure. In other creatures
the eyes are moveable, and two in number, one on each
side of the head: in insects, the genus of cancri excepted, the
eyes are fixed; they have no eye-brows, but the outer coating is
hard and transparent.</p>

<p>The greater part of insects have two eyes; in the monoculus
they approach so near to each other, as to appear like one; the
gyrinus has four eyes, the scorpion six, the spider eight, and the
scolopendra three.</p>

<p>Of the eyes of insects, some have them single, that is, placed
at a small distance from each other; while others are furnished
with an indefinite number, all placed in one common case or
socket; the latter are generally termed the reticulated eyes.</p>

<h5>OF THE RETICULATED EYES OF INSECTS.</h5>

<p>The microscope does not disclose greater wonders, when it
exhibits to us millions of animals invisible to the naked eye, where
we should suppose nothing living existed, than when it discovers
to us hidden beauties in those, which, though they are large
enough to be seen by our natural eye, yet in their several minute
parts are no ways discernible, but by the assistance of glasses.</p>

<p>Thus we readily discern those protuberances on the heads of
insects, which are formed by a congeries of eyes; we can even
perceive that they consist of a number of lines crossing each
other with great regularity and exactness at some little distance,
like the meshes of a net. By this we know that they are reticulated<span class="pagenum" id="Page195">[195]</span>
substances; but in what manner they are so, can only be
shewn by the microscope.</p>

<p>The eyes of the libellula, on account of their size, are peculiarly
well adapted for microscopical examination; and, by the assistance
of the instrument, you will find that they are divided into
a number of hexagonal cells, each of which forms a complete eye.
The external parts of these eyes are so perfectly smooth, and so
well polished, that, when viewed as opake objects, they will,
like so many mirrors, reflect the images of all the surrounding objects.
The figure of a candle may be seen on their surface multiplied
almost to infinity, shifting its beam to each eye, according
to the motion given to it by the hands of the observer. Other
creatures are obliged to turn their eyes towards the object, but
insects have eyes directed thereto, on whatsoever side it may
appear: they more than realize the wonderful accounts of fabulous
history: poets gave to Argus an hundred eyes; insects are
furnished with thousands, having the benefit of vision on every
side with the utmost ease and speed, though without any motion
of the eye or flexion of the neck.</p>

<p>Each of these protuberances, in its natural state, is a body cut
into a number of faces; like an artificial multiplying glass; but
with this superiority in the workmanship, that as there, every face
is plane, here, every one is convex, immensely more numerous,
and contained in a much smaller space. If one of these protuberant
substances be nicely taken from the head of the insect,
washed clean, and placed before the microscope, its structure is
elegantly seen, and it becomes an object worthy of the highest
admiration. You will find that each of the eyes is an hexagon,
varying in its size according to its situation in the head, and
that each of them is a distinct convex lens, and has the same effect
in forming the image of an object placed before it. Of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page196">[196]</span>
you will be convinced, by turning the mirror of the microscope
so as to bring the picture of some well-defined object under the
eye; thus, turn it towards a house, and in the eye of the insect
you will perceive the house diminished to a box, but multiplied
into a city; turn it towards a soldier, and you will have an army
of pigmies performing every motion at the same instant of time;
again, turn the mirror towards a candle, and you will have a
beautiful and resplendent blaze from multitudes of regular flames.</p>

<p>Hooke, Catalan, &amp;c. have shewn that these small eyes are furnished
with every requisite of vision, and that each of them has the
use, the power, and properties of an eye. But we must have recourse
to the works of Swammerdam for a full account of the astonishing
organization of the eyes of insects. Among other things,
he has shewn, that under each facet there is a pyramid of fibres
broad at the base, and growing smaller as it proceeds inwards; the
pyramid has the same number of sides as the eye, and there are
as many hexagonal pyramids, as there are small facets or eyes in
the insect. An innumerable number of pulmonary tubes ascend
these fibres, terminating in a white fibrous convex membrane;
under these membranes there is another, still more delicate and
transparent; beneath this, a second species of fibres is transversely
applied, like so many beams to support the pyramids that are laid
upon them. Still we cannot determine with certainty, how these
numerous inlets to sight operate for the service of the animal;
they may increase the field of view, augment the intensity of
light, and be productive of advantages of which we can have no
conception.</p>

<p>Hooke computed 14000 of these facets in the two eyes of a
drone; Leeuwenhoek reckoned 6036 in the two eyes of a silkworm,
when in its fly state; in the eyes of the libellula he
reckoned 12544 hexangular lenses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page197">[197]</span></p>

<p>Swammerdam covered the reticulated eyes of certain insects
with black paint; in this state they flew at random, and seemed
to be deprived of their strength; when they settled, they did not
avoid the hand that was going to take hold of them. Reaumur
made similar experiments on the eyes of bees, which concurred
with those of Swammerdam.</p>

<p>Some ephemera flies have four reticulated eyes, two of which
are placed as in the common fly; the other two are placed, one
beside the other, upon the upper part of the head, and have the
appearance of a kind of mushroom, the head extended somewhat
beyond the stalk. The first pair are of a brown colour, those of
the mushroom form are of a very beautiful citron colour.</p>

<p>In some of the fly class, these reticulated eyes are little inferior
in colour and brilliance to the brightest gem. The colour varies
in different species; in some you find it green, in others red, &amp;c.
some have a most elegant changeable colour thrown over them,
partly purple, partly green, and partly of that brassy hue, which
is seen on the backs of some of our beetles, and which is not
equalled by any other production of art or nature.</p>

<p>Fig. 3. <a href="#Plate16">Plate XVI.</a> is a representation of a small part of the
cornea of a libellula, as seen by the microscope; the sides of the
hexagons in some positions of the light, appear of a fine gold
colour, and divided into three parallel borders. Fig. 4. the same
object of its natural size.</p>

<p>Fig. 5. <a href="#Plate16">Plate XVI.</a> represents a small portion of the cornea of a
lobster; here each of the eyes are small squares, not hexagons; a
conformation which admits a smaller number in the same surface;
so great a number was not necessary in this instance, as the eyes
of the lobster are moveable. Fig. 6. the same of its natural size.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page198">[198]</span></p>

<h5>OF THE EYES OF THE MONOCULUS POLYPHEMUS.</h5>

<p>The monoculus polyphemus, or king crab, has four eyes, two
large and two small ones; the large eyes are formed of a great
number of transparent amber-like cones, the small ones of a single
cone,</p>

<p>&#8220;The internal surface of the large eyes, examined with the
microscope, is found to be thick set with a great number of small
transparent cones, of an amber colour, the bases of which stand
downward, and their points upward next the eye of the observer.
The cones in general have an oblique direction, except some in
the middle of the cornea, about thirty in number, the direction of
which is perpendicular. The center of every cone being the
most transparent part, and that through which the light passes,
on that account the perpendicular or central cones always appear
beautifully illuminated at their points. In a word, they are all
so disposed, as that a certain number of them receive the light
from whatever point it may issue, and transmit it to the immediate
organ of sight, which we may reasonably suppose is placed
underneath them. The cones are not all of the same length;
those on the edges of the cornea are the longest, from whence
they gradually diminish as they approach the center, where they
are not above half the length of those on the edges.</p>

<p>&#8220;The structure of the small eyes being less elaborate, their
internal appearance, when placed in the microscope, will be described
in a few words. They consist of an oval transparent
horny plate, of an amber colour, in the center of which stands a
single cone, through which and the oval plate the light passes.&#8221;<a href="#Footnote55" id="FNanchor55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<h5>OF THE EYES OF A SPIDER.</h5>

<p>Though the form of this insect is naturally disgusting, yet the
eyes make a beautiful object for the microscope. They have generally
eight; two on the top of the head, that look directly
upwards; two in the front, a little below the foregoing, to discover
what passes before it; on each side a couple more, whereof
one points sideways forward, the other sideways backward; so
that the spider can nearly see all around. These eyes are immoveable,
and seem to be formed of a hard transparent horny
substance. A portion of each sphere projects externally beyond
the socket, the largest part is sunk within it. There is round
each eye a circular transparent membrane. Mr. Baker placed the
eye of a spider over a pin-hole made through a piece of card, and
then applied it as a lens to examine objects; he found it magnified
the objects greatly, but that it did not exhibit them distinctly;
this he however attributed to the length of time the spider had
been dead whose eye he used. The number of eyes is not the
same in all species of the spider.</p>

<h5>OF THE STEMMATA.</h5>

<p>It might be imagined, that as every fly has two reticulated
eyes, they could not have occasion for more; but so it has
not appeared to that <span class="smcapall">GREAT BEING</span> who formed them, for many
are furnished besides with other eyes, differing in form and construction
from those that are reticulated.</p>

<p>These were first noticed by M. de la Hire; they are three lucid
protuberances placed on the back part of the head of many
insects: their surface is glossy, of an hemispheric figure, and a coal
black colour. They are transparent, and disposed in a triangular
form; by modern naturalists they are termed stemmata.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page200">[200]</span></p>

<p>Reaumur made experiments on these eyes, similar to those he
had made on the reticulated ones, and found that when the stemmata
were covered with dark varnish, the insects flew but to a
small distance, and always at random.</p>

<p>No insect is, I believe, found with both kind of eyes, unless in
its perfect state: there are many species which are not furnished
with stemmata, gnats and tipul&aelig; are without them.</p>

<p>We are apt to suppose that nature has lavished all her bounty
upon her larger creatures, and left her minims of existence, as
Shakspeare phrases it, unfinished; with what different ideas must
those be impressed, who find the apparatus for vision in these
small creatures so various and so wonderful in their structure,
and who must perceive so much design and order manifested in
the position, construction, and number of these delicate and useful
organs.</p>

<h4>OF THE BODY OF INSECTS.</h4>

<p>The trunk or body of the insect is situated between the head
and abdomen. Naturalists divide it into three parts; the thorax,
scutellum, and sternum.</p>

<p>The thorax is the upper part of the body, it is of various shapes
and proportions; the sides and back of it are often armed with
points.</p>

<p>The scutellum, or escutcheon, is the lower part of the body,
and is generally of a triangular form; though it adheres to the
thorax, it is easily distinguished therefrom by its figure, and often
by an intervening suture. It seems intended to assist in expanding
the wings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page201">[201]</span></p>

<p>The sternum is situated on the under part of the thorax; in
some species it is pointed behind, as in the elateres; in others,
bifid, as in some of the dytisci.</p>

<h4>OF THE ABDOMEN OF INSECTS.</h4>

<p>The abdomen, or under part of the body, contains the stomach,
the intestines, the air vessels, &amp;c. It is composed of several rings
or segments, so that it may be moved in various directions, or
lengthened and shortened at pleasure; in some it is formed of
one piece only. It is perforated with spiracula, or breathing
holes, and is terminated by the tail.</p>

<p>The spiracula are small oblong holes or pores placed singly
one on each side of every ring of the abdomen; these are the
means or instruments of respiration, supply the want of lungs,
and form a peculiar characteristic of insects.</p>

<h4>OF THE LIMBS OF INSECTS.</h4>

<p>By the limbs are here meant the instruments used by the insect
both for motion and defence. They are, al&aelig;, the wings; halteres,
the poisers; pedes, the legs; cauda, the tail; and aculeus, the sting.</p>

<h4>OF THE WINGS OF INSECTS.</h4>

<p>The wings are those organs by which the insect is enabled to
fly; some have only two, others are furnished with four, two on
each side; these are, in some, of the same size; in others, the superior
ones are much larger than the inferior: Linn&aelig;us has made
them the foundation of the order into which he has divided this
numerous class of beings. The variety in the form and structure<span class="pagenum" id="Page202">[202]</span>
of the wings is almost infinite; the beauty of their colouring,
the art with which they are connected to the body, the curious
manner in which some are folded up, the fine articulations
provided for this purpose, by which they are laid up in
their cases when out of use, and yet are ready to be extended
in a moment for flight; together with the various ramifications,
by which the nourishing juices are circulated, and the wing
strengthened, afford a fund of rational investigation highly entertaining;
exhibiting, particularly when examined by the microscope,
a most wonderful display of divine wisdom and power.
The more delicate and transparent wings are covered and protected
by elytra, or cases, which are generally hard and opake.
The wings of moths and butterflies are mostly farinaceous, covered
with a fine dust; by the assistance of the microscope, we
discover that this dust is a regular assemblage of organized scales,
which will be more particularly noticed hereafter.</p>

<p>The following names are made use of to describe the different
kinds of wings. They are first distinguished, with respect to
their surfaces, into superior and inferior. The part next the head
is called the anterior part; that nearer the tail, the posterior part.
The interior part is that next the abdomen; the exterior part is
the outermost edge.</p>

<p>Those wings are termed plicatiles, which are folded when the
insect is at rest, as in the wasp. Plan&aelig;; those which are incapable
of being folded. Erect&aelig;; whose superior surfaces are
brought in contact when the insect is at rest, as in the ephemera,
papiliones, &amp;c. Patentes; if they are extended horizontally when
the insect is at rest, as in the phal&aelig;n&aelig; geometr&aelig;. Incumbentes;
those insects which, when they are not in motion, cover horizontally
with their wings the superior part of the abdomen. Deflex&aelig;;<span class="pagenum" id="Page203">[203]</span>
those are also incumbentes, but not horizontally, the outer
edges declining towards the sides, Revers&aelig;, are also deflex&aelig;,
with this addition, that the edges of the inferior wings project
from under the anterior part of the superior ones. Dentat&aelig;; with
serrated or scolloped edges. Caudat&aelig;; in these some of the fibres
of the wings are extended beyond the margin into a kind of tail.
Reticulat&aelig;; when the veins or membranes of the wings put on
the appearance of net-work.</p>

<p>The wings are further distinguished by their ornaments, being
painted with spots, macul&aelig;; bands, fasci&aelig;; streaks, strig&aelig;: when
these are extended lengthways, they are called lines, lin&aelig;; and if
with dots, punct&aelig;; one or more rings are termed eyes, ocelli; if
the spots are shaped like a kidney, they are termed stigmata.</p>

<p>The elytra, or crustaceous cases of the wings are extended when
the insect flies, and shut when it rests, forming a longitudinal suture
down the middle of the back; they are of various shapes, and
distinguished by the following names:</p>

<p>Abbreviata; when they are shorter than the abdomen. Truncata;
when their extremities terminate in a transverse direct line.
Fastigiata; when of equal or greater length than the abdomen,
and terminating in a transverse line. Serrata; having their external
margins edged with teeth or notches. Spinosa; when their
exterior surfaces are covered with small sharp points. Scabra;
when they are very rough. Striata; marked with slender longitudinal
furrows. Porcata; having sharp longitudinal ridges. Sulcata;
with deep furrows. They are likewise distinguished by the
denomination of Hemelytra, when their cases are neither so hard
as the elytra, nor so delicate as the transparent wings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page204">[204]</span></p>

<h5>OF THE HALTERES OR POISERS OF INSECTS.</h5>

<p>Under the wings of most insects which have only two, there is
a small head placed on a stalk, frequently under a little arched
scale; these are called halteres, poisers; they appear to be rudiments
of the hinder wings: it has been supposed that they serve
to keep the body in equilibrio when the insect is flying.</p>

<h5>OF THE ELYTRA, AND WINGS UNDER THE ELYTRA.</h5>

<p>I have already observed, that the delicate and transparent wings
of many insects are covered and protected by elytra, or cases,
which also in some measure act as wings.</p>

<p>These exterior cases are harder and more opake than the wings
under them; they are generally highly polished, and often enriched
with various colours, adorned with ornamental flutings, and studded
with brilliants, whose beauties are beyond description. All these
ornaments are united in the curculio imperialis,<a href="#Footnote56" id="FNanchor56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> or diamond beetle,
one of the richest and most magnificent creatures in nature;
the head, the wings, the legs, &amp;c. are curiously beset with scales
of a most splendid appearance, outvying the ruby, saphire, and
emerald, forming in miniature one of the most noble phenomena
that the colours of light can exhibit. It is said, that in the
Brazils, from whence they come, it is almost impossible to look
at them on a sunny day, when they are flying in little swarms,
so great is the glowing splendor of their heightened colours.</p>

Ins. 184. 129.&mdash;Drury. Ins. 2 Tab. 33, Fig. 1.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The strength and hardness of the elytra are admirably adapted
to the various purposes of the insects to which they are appropriated;
at the same time that they protect the tender wings beneath<span class="pagenum" id="Page205">[205]</span>
them, they serve as a shield to the body; while the ribs,
and other prominences, contribute to lessen the friction and diminish
the pressure to which they are often exposed. In most of
these insects, the under wing is longer and larger than the exterior
one, so that it is obliged to be bent and folded up, in order to
lye under the elytra; for this purpose they are furnished with
strong muscles, and proper articulations to display or conceal
them at pleasure.</p>

<h5>OF THE WINGS OF THE FORFICULA AURICULARIA, OR
EARWIG.</h5>

<p>Fig. 1. <a href="#Plate14">Plate XIV.</a> is a magnified view of the wing of an earwig.
Fig. 2. the natural size. Though the insect is so very common,
yet few people know that it has wings, and fewer yet have
seen them; they are of a curious and elegant texture, and wonderful
structure. The upper part is crustaceous and opake, while
the other part is beautifully transparent. They fold up into a very
small compass, and lie neatly concealed under the elytra, which
are not more than a sixth part of the wing in size. They first
fold back the parts A B, and then shut up the ribs like a fan; the
strong muscles used for this purpose are seen at the upper part
of the figure. The ribs are extended from the center to the
outer edge, others are extended only from the edge about half-way;
but they are all united by a kind of band, at a small, but
equal distance from the edge; the whole evidently contrived to
strengthen the wing, and facilitate the various motions thereof;
so that, in these wings you find all the motions that are in the
most elaborate and portable umbrellas, executed with a neatness
and elegance surpassing description. The earwig is a very destructive
animal, doing considerable injury to most kinds of wall
fruit, to carnations, and other fine flowers, &amp;c. and as they only<span class="pagenum" id="Page206">[206]</span>
feed in the night, they escape the search of the gardener. Reeds
open at both ends, and placed among fruit trees, are a good trap
for them, as they croud into these open channels, and may be
blown out into a tub of water. As they conceal themselves in
the day-time, those that are curious in flowers place tobacco
pipes, lobster claws, &amp;c. on the top of their garden sticks, in
order to catch them. This insect differs very little in appearance
in its three different states. De Geer asserts, that the female sits
on her eggs, and broods over the young ones, as a hen does over
her chickens.</p>

<h5>OF THE WINGS OF THE HEMEROBIUS PERLA.</h5>

<p>So infinite is the variety displayed in the disposition, structure,
and ornaments of the wings of insects, that only to enumerate
them would fill many pages; I must leave this subject to be further
pursued by the reader, contenting myself with presenting him
with the view of a wing of the hemerobius perla, as it appears
under the microscope. The insect to which it belongs, has acquired
the name of hemerobius, from the shortness of its life, as
it seldom lives more than two or three days in the fly state. Linn&aelig;us
has placed it in his fourth class, among those insects which
have four transparent wings and no sting. The body of the insect
is of a fine green colour; the eyes appear like two delicate
beads of burnished gold, whence it is by many called the golden
eye. The wings are delicate and elegant, nearly of a length, and
exactly similar; they are composed of a beautiful thin transparent
membrane, furnished with slender fine ribs, regularly and elegantly
disposed, adorned with hairs, and slightly tinged with
green. Fig. 1. <a href="#Plate15">Plate XV.</a> exhibits its magnified appearance;
Fig. 2. the natural size.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page207">[207]</span></p>

<h5>OF THE WINGS OF MOTHS AND BUTTERFLIES.</h5>

<p>The wings of these insects are mostly farinaceous, being covered
with a fine dust, which renders them opake, and produces
those beautiful and variegated colours by which they are so richly
adorned, and so profusely decked. If this be wiped off, you find
the remaining part, or naked wing, to consist of a number of ribs,
like those in the leaves of plants; but of a crustaceous or talcy
nature; the largest rib runs along and fortifies the exterior edge
of the wing; the interior edge is strengthened by a smaller vessel
or rib. The ribs are all hollow, by which means the wing,
though comparatively large, is very light. The substance between
the ribs, and which constitutes the body of the wing, resembles
talc,<a href="#Footnote57" id="FNanchor57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> surprizingly thin and transparent; as this is extremely
tender, one use of the scales may be to protect it from
injuries. When the moth emerges from the chrysalis, the wings
are soft and thick, and if they be examined in that state, will be
found to consist of two membranes, that may be raised up and
separated, by blowing between them with a small tube: the ribs<span class="pagenum" id="Page208">[208]</span>
lie between these membranes. You may with the assistance of
glasses discover certain strait and circular rows of extremely minute
holes, running from rib to rib, or forming figures in the
intermediate spaces, which seem to answer to the figures and
variegations on the complete wing, and are probably the sockets
for the stalks or stems of the small scales.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote57"><a href="#FNanchor57" class="label">[57]</a> As the author&#8217;s
idea of this substance being of the nature of talc, does not appear correct,
and I cannot find that entomologists are agreed in the definition of it, I shall just give the following
extract on the subject from the Cyclop&#339;dia by Rees, and submit the decision to the
reader.</p>

<p>&#8220;The substance which connects and fills up the spaces between these ribs, is of so peculiar a
nature, that it is not easy to find any name to design it by, at least there is no substance that
enters the composition of the bodies of the larger animals, that is at all analogous to it. It is
a white substance, transparent and friable, and seems indeed to differ in nothing from that of
the large and thick ribs, but in that it is extended into thin plates; but this is saying little toward
the determining what it really is, since we are as much at a loss to know by what name to
call the substance they are composed of. Malpighi indeed calls them bones; but though they
do serve in the place of bones, rendering the wing firm and strong, &amp;c. yet, when strictly examined,
they do not appear to have any thing of the structure of bones, but appear rather of the
substance of scales, or of that sort of imperfect scales, of which, the covering of crustaceous
insects is composed.&#8221; <span class="smcap">Edit.</span></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Ever since the microscope was invented, the dust that covers
these wings has engaged the attention of microscopic observers;
as by this instrument it is found to be a regular collection
of organized scales of various shapes, and in whose construction
there is as much symmetry, as there is beauty in their colours.
A view of some of these scales, as they appear in the microscope,
is exhibited at F E H I, in Fig. 7. <a href="#Plate16">Plate XVI.</a> and in Fig. 8. of the
natural size. Their shapes are not only very different in moths of
various species, but those on the same moth are also found to
differ. Of the scales, some are so long and slender that they
resemble hairs, except that they are a little flattened and divided
at the ends; some are short and broad; some are notched at the
edges, others smooth; some are nearly oval, while others are triangular:
they are mostly furnished with a short stalk or stem to
fix them to the wing. With the microscope, a variety of large
stripes or ribs are to be discovered; between these larger lines,
minuter ones may be seen with a deep magnifier. The larger
stripes rise in general from the exterior notches; some have a rib
running down the middle, through their whole length. The
upper and under parts of the wing are equally supplied with
them.</p>

<p>The regular arrangement of these plates, one beside and partly
covering the other, as in the tiling of an house, is best seen by
examining a wing in the opake microscope. The prodigious
number of small scales which cover the wings of these beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page209">[209]</span>
insects, is a sure proof of their utility to them, because they are
given by <span class="smcapall">HIM</span> who makes nothing in vain.</p>

<p>That the lively and variegated colours, which adorn the wings
of the moth and butterfly, arise from the small scales or plates
that are planted therein, is very evident from this, that if they be
brushed off from it, the wing is perfectly transparent: but whence
this profusion and difference of colour on the same wing? is a
question as difficult to resolve, as that of Prior, when he asks.</p>

<p>As the wings of the moths and butterflies are very light, they
can support themselves for a long time in the air; their manner
of flying is ungraceful, generally moving in a zigzag line, to the
right and to the left, alternately ascending and descending; this
undulating motion however has its uses, as it disappoints the
birds who chase them in taking aim; by which means they frequently
elude their pursuit, though continued for a considerable
time.</p>

<p>Dr. Hooke<a href="#Footnote58" id="FNanchor58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> endeavoured to investigate the nature of the motions
of the wings of insects; and, although he was not able, from
the experiments he made, to give a satisfactory account of them,
yet as they may be useful to some future inquirer, and lead him
more readily into the path of truth, I hope an extract therefrom
will not prove unacceptable to the reader. To investigate the
mode or manner of moving their wings, he considered with attention
those spinning insects that suspend, or as it were poise<span class="pagenum" id="Page210">[210]</span>
themselves in one place in the air, without rising or falling, or
even moving backwards or forwards; by looking down on these,
he could, by a kind of faint shadow, perceive the utmost extremes
of the vibratory motion of their wings; the shadow, while they
were thus suspended, was not very long, but was lengthened
when they endeavoured to fly forwards. He next tried by fixing
the legs of a fly upon the top of the stalk of a feather with glue,
wax, &amp;c. and then making it endeavour to fly away; he was
thereby able to view it in any posture. From hence he collected,
that the extreme limits of the vibrations were usually somewhat
about the length of the body distant from each other, often
shorter, and sometimes longer. The foremost limit was generally
a little above the back, and the hinder one somewhat beneath the
belly; between these, to judge by the sound, they seemed to
move with an equal velocity. The manner of their moving them,
if a just idea can be formed by the shadow of the wing, and a
consideration of its nature and structure, seemed to be this: the
wing being supposed to be in the extreme limit, it is then nearly
horizontal, the forepart only being a little depressed; in this situation
the wing moves to the lower limit; before it arrives at this,
the hinder part begins to move fastest; the area of the wing begins
to dip behind, and in that posture it seems to be moved to the
upper limit back again. These vibrations, judging by the sound,
and comparing them with a string tuned in unison thereto, consist
of many hundreds, if not thousands, in a second of time.
The powers of the governing faculty of the insect, and the vivacity
of its sensations, whereby every organ is stimulated to act
with so much velocity and regularity, surpass our present comprehension.</p>

<h4>PEDES THE FEET, AND LEGS OF INSECTS.</h4>

<p>These are admirably adapted for their intended service, to give
the most convenient and proper motion, and, from the variety in<span class="pagenum" id="Page211">[211]</span>
their construction, their various articulations, &amp;c. furnish the microscopic
observer with an abundance of curious and interesting
objects: the most general number is six; many of the class aptera
have eight, as the spider; the crab has ten; the oniscus fourteen;
the julus has from seventy to one-hundred and twenty on each
side. The legs of those insects that have not more than ten, are
affixed to the trunk; while those that exceed that number, have
part fixed to the trunk, the rest to the abdomen.</p>

<p>The legs of insects are generally divided into four parts. The
first, which is usually the largest, is called the femur; the second,
or tibia, is joined to the former, and is commonly of the same size
throughout, and longer than the femur; this is followed by the
third part, which is distinguished by the name of tarsus, or
foot; it is composed of several joints, the one articulated to the
other, the number of rings varying in different insects; the tarsus
is terminated by the unguis, or claw.</p>

<p>The writers on natural history, in order to render their descriptions
clear and accurate, have given several names to the legs of
insects, from the nature of the motions produced by them. Thus
cursorii, from that of running; these are the most numerous.
The saltatorii, those that are used for leaping; the thighs of these
are remarkably large, by which means they possess considerable
strength and power to leap to great distances. The natatorii,
those that serve as oars for swimming; the feet of these are flat
and edged with hairs, possessing a proper surface to strike
against the water, as in the dytiscus, notonecta, &amp;c. Such feet
as have no claws are termed mutici. The chel&aelig;, or claws, are
an enlargement of the extremity of the fore feet, each of which is
furnished with two lesser claws, which act like a thumb and
finger, as in the crab. The under part of the feet in some insects
is covered with a kind of brush or sponge, by which they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page212">[212]</span>
enabled to walk with ease, on the most polished substances, and
in situations from which it would seem they must necessarily
fall.</p>

<p>Motion is one of the principal phenomena of nature; it is as it
were the soul of our system, and is as admirable in the smallest
animal, as in the universe at large. It is the principal agent in
producing all that diversity and change which perpetually affect
every object in the creation. The motions of animals are proportioned
to their weight and structure, a flea can leap to the
distance of at least two hundred times its own length; were an
elephant, a camel, or an horse to leap in the same proportion,
their weight would crush them to atoms. The same remark is
applicable to spiders, worms, and other insects; the softness of
their texture, and the comparative smallness of their specific gravity,
enable them to fall without injury from heights that would
prove fatal to larger and heavier animals.<a href="#Footnote59" id="FNanchor59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote59"><a href="#FNanchor59" class="label">[59]</a> The parts of some of the larger
animals are, however, so admirably constructed for swiftness,
as to enable them to perform surprizing acts of agility; for instance, the Siberian jerboa, mus saliens,
Pennant; this animal springs forward by successive leaping so very nimbly, that it is said to
be very difficult for a man well mounted to overtake it; it is about the size of a large rat. The
kanguroo, opossum of Pennant, macropus giganteus, Shaw, leaps to so uncommon a height,
and to so great a distance, as to outstrip the swiftest greyhound; its size is that of a full-grown
sheep. Accurate coloured figures of both these extraordinary animals are given in that elegant
work, the Naturalist&#8217;s Miscellany. <span class="smcap">Edit.</span></p>

<p>Many insects can only move the thigh in a vertical direction,
while others can move it in a variety of ways. The progressive
motion of insects, and the various methods employed to effect it,
will be found a very curious and important subject, and well
worthy the attention of the naturalist. The intelligent mechanic
will not find it lost labour if he bestow some time on the same
subject. Very little has been done on this head, and that principally<span class="pagenum" id="Page213">[213]</span>
by Reaumur, in his excellent Memoires; and by M. Weiss,
in a Memoir published in the Journal de Physique for 1771. The
reader may also consult Borelli de Motu Animalium.</p>

<h4>OF THE TAIL AND STING OF INSECTS.</h4>

<p>Cauda, the tail, terminates the abdomen, and is constructed in
a wonderful manner for answering the purposes for which it is
formed, namely, to direct the motion of the insect, to serve as an
instrument of defence, or for depositing the eggs; the figure and
size thereof varying in each genus and its families. In most
insects it is simple, simplex, and yet capable of being extended
or drawn back at pleasure; in others, elongata, elongated, as in
the crab and scorpion; setacea, shaped like a bristle, as in the raphidia;
triseta, with three appendages like bristles, as in the ephemera;
in some it is forked, furcata, as in the podura; and in
others it is furnished with a pair of forceps, forcipata, as in the
forficula; in the blatta, grylli, and others, it is foliosa, or like a
leaf; in the scorpion and panorpa it is telifera, furnished with a
dart or sting. Further particulars may be obtained from the
Philosophia Entomologica of Fabricius.</p>

<p>Aculeus, or the sting, is an instrument with which insects wound
and instil a poison; the sting generally proceeds from the under
part of the last ring of the belly: in some it is sharp and pointed,
in others serrated or formed like a saw. It is used by many insects
both as an offensive and defensive weapon; by others it is only
used to pierce the substances where they mean to deposit their
eggs. This instrument cannot be properly seen or known, but
with the assistance of a microscope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page214">[214]</span></p>

<h5>OF THE STING OF A BEE.</h5>

<p>Of bees, it is only the labourers and the queen that have stings.
The apparatus is of a very curious construction, fitted for inflicting
a wound, and at the same time conveying poison into that
wound.</p>

<p>The apparatus consists of two piercers conducted in a sheath,
groove, or director.</p>

<p>This groove is rather large at the base, but terminates in a
point; it is affixed to the last scale of the upper side of the abdomen
by thirteen thin scales, six on each side, and one behind
the rectum. These scales inclose the rectum all round, and are
attached to each other by thin membranes which allow of a variety
of motions; three of them are however attached more closely
to a round and curved process, which comes from the basis of the
groove in which the sting lies, as also to the curved arms of the
sting which spread out externally. The two stings may be said
to begin by those two curved processes at their union with the
scales, and converging towards the groove at its base, which they
enter, and then pass along to its point.</p>

<p>The two stings are serrated or notched towards the points;
they can be thrust out a little way, and drawn within it. These
parts are all moved by very strong muscles, which give motions
in almost all directions, but most particularly outwards. It is
wonderful how deep they will pierce solid bodies with this sting.</p>

<p>To perform this by mere force, two things are necessary, power
of muscles, and strength of sting; neither of which they seem to
possess in a sufficient degree. Mr. J. Hunter thinks that it cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page215">[215]</span>
be by simple force, because the least pressure bends the sting in
any direction. It is probable that the serrated edges may assist,
by cutting their way like a saw.</p>

<p>The apparatus for the poison consists of two small ducts,
which are the glands that secrete the poison; these lie in the
abdomen among the air cells, they soon however unite into one
oblong bag; at the opposite end of which a duct passes out,
which runs towards the angle where the two stings meet, and,
entering between them, forms a canal by the union of the two
stings at this point. From the serrated construction of the stings
the bee can seldom disengage them, and hence, when they pass
into materials of too strong a nature, the bee generally leaves
them behind, and often a part of the bowels therewith.<a href="#Footnote60" id="FNanchor60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<h3>DISTINGUISHING CRITERIA OF INSECTS.</h3>

<p>It has already been observed, that the bodies of insects are
covered with a hard skin, answering the purpose of an internal
skeleton, and forming one of the characters by which they are
distinguished from other animals. This external covering is very
strong in those insects which, from their manner of life, are particularly
liable to great friction, or violent compression; but is
more tender and delicate in such as are not so exposed. The
skin of insects, like that of larger animals, is porous; the pores in
some species are very large; many insects often change or cast off
their skin; this exuvia forms an excellent object for the microscope.</p>

<p>Another distinguishing criterion of insects is the colour of their
circulating fluid or blood, which is never red; this, at first sight,
seems liable to some objections, on account of the drop of red<span class="pagenum" id="Page216">[216]</span>
liquor which is often procured from small insects when squeezed
or pressed to pieces. It does not appear, however, that this is
the blood of the little animal; when it existed as a worm there
was no such appearance, and when transformed to the perfect, or
fly state, it is only found in the eye, and not in the body, which
would be the case if it circulated in the veins of the insect. It is
probable there is a circulation of some fluid analogous to the
blood in most insects: with the assistance of the microscope this
circulation may be perceived in many; but the circulating liquor
is not red.</p>

<p>To these discriminating characteristics we may also add the following
particulars:</p>

<p>1. That the body of insects is divided by incisur&aelig;, or transversal
divisions, from whence they take their name.</p>

<p>2. That they are furnished with antenn&aelig;, which are placed
upon the fore part of the head; these are jointed and moveable
in various directions.</p>

<p>3. That no insect in its perfect state, or after it has gone
through all its transformations, has less than six legs, though
many have more. There are some moths, whose two fore feet
are so small, as scarcely to entitle them to that name.</p>

<p>4. That insects have neither the organs of smell nor hearing;
at least they have not as yet been discovered, though it is reported
that Fabricius has lately found and described the organs of hearing
in a lobster.<a href="#Footnote61" id="FNanchor61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote61"><a href="#FNanchor61" class="label">[61]</a> That many insects
are susceptible of a shrill or loud noise, is a fact so well ascertained,
as to be indisputable; but in what manner, or by what organs the sensation is conveyed, is
not so evident; Barbut, however, supposes them to possess the sense of hearing in a very distinct
manner. Many insects, he observes, are well known to be endued with the power of uttering
sounds, viz. large beetles, bees, wasps, common flies, gnats, &amp;c. The sphinx atropos squeaks,
when hurt, nearly as loud as a mouse: this faculty certainly must be intended for some purpose,
and as they vary their cry occasionally, it appears designed to give notice of pleasure or pain, or
some affection in the creature which possesses it. &#8220;The knowledge of their sounds,&#8221; says he,
&#8220;is undoubtedly confined to their tribe, and is a language intelligible to them only; saving when
violence obliges the animal to exert the voice of nature in distress, craving compassion; then all
animals understand the doleful cry; for instance, attack a bee or wasp near the hive or nest, or
a few of them; the consequence will be, the animal or animals, by a different tone of voice will
express his or their disapprobation or pain; that sound is known to the hive to be plaintive, and
that their brother or brethren require their assistance, and the offending party seldom escapes
with impunity. Now, if they had not the sense of hearing, they could not have known the
danger their brother or brethren were in, by the alteration of their tone.&#8221; Another proof, which
he reckons still more decisive, was taken from his observation on a spider, which had made a very
large web on a wooden railing, and was at the time in a cavity behind one of the rails, at a
considerable distance from the part where a fly had entangled himself; the spider became immediately
sensible of it, though, from the situation of the rail, he could not possibly have seen
the fly. This observation, however, cannot be considered as conclusive, as it is very probable
that the spider was alarmed by the tremulous motion of the threads of the web occasioned by
the fluttering of the fly, which he might well know how to distinguish from their vibration by
the wind. It is this author&#8217;s opinion, that the organ of hearing is situated in the antenn&aelig;; he
likewise supposes that the organs of smell reside in the palpi or feelers. For his reasoning on
these subjects, see the Genera Insectorum, Preface, p. vii. &amp; seq. <span class="smcap">Edit.</span></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page217">[217]</span></p>

<p>5. That they do not respire air by the mouth, but that they
inspire and exhale it by means of organs which are placed on
the body.</p>

<p>6. That they move the jaws from right to left, not up and
down.</p>

<p>7. That they have neither eye-lid nor pupil.</p>

<p>To these we may also add, that the mechanism resulting from
the <span class="smcapall">LIFE</span> of insects is not of so compound a nature as in animals
of a larger size. They have less variety of organs, though some
of them are more multiplied; and it is by the number and situation
of these that their rank in the great scale of beings is to be
determined.</p>

<p>These characters are often united in the same insect; there are,
however, some species in which one or two of them are wanting.</p>

<p>The student in entomology, who wishes to attain a proper
knowledge of the science, and indeed every microscopic observer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page218">[218]</span>
desirous of availing himself of the discoveries of others, and of
communicating intelligibly his own, will find it necessary to make
himself conversant with the various classes, genera, &amp;c. into
which insects have been divided by Linn&aelig;us. Every system has
its defects, and probably some may be found in that of this truly
celebrated naturalist, but the purpose of science is answered by
using those discriminations which are generally adopted.</p>

<p>The following general idea of the Linn&aelig;an classes may serve
as a foundation for this knowledge: a more particular account
may be obtained by consulting the under-mentioned works.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Class the first. <span class="smcap">Coleoptera</span>. The insects of this class have
four wings; the upper ones, called the elytra, are crustaceous,
being of a hard horny substance; these, when shut, form a longitudinal
suture down the back, as in the scarab&aelig;us, melolontha,
or cockchaffer, &amp;c.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Hemiptera.</span> These have also four wings; but the elytra
are different, being half crustaceous, half membranaceous: the
wings do not form a longitudinal suture, but extend the one over
the other, as in the gryllus, grasshopper, &amp;c.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Lepidoptera.</span> Those which have four membranaceous
wings covered with fine scales, appearing to the naked eye like

wings, which are generally reticulated, the tail without a
sting, as in the libellula, or dragon fly.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Hymenoptera.</span> These, like the preceding class, have four
membranaceous naked wings; but the abdomen is furnished with
a sting, as in the bee, wasp, ichneumon, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>OF THE TRANSFORMATION OF INSECTS.</h3>

<p>Insects are farther distinguished from other animals by the
wonderful changes that all those of the winged species without
exception, and some which are destitute of wings, must pass
through, before they arrive at the perfection of their nature.
Most animals retain, during their whole life, the same form
which they receive at their birth; but insects go through wonderful
exterior and interior changes, insomuch that the same individual,
at its birth and middle state, differs essentially from that
under which it appears when arrived at a state of maturity; and
this difference is not confined to marks, colour, or texture, but is
extended to their form, proportion, motion, organs, and habits of
life.</p>

<p>The ancient writers on natural history were not unacquainted
with these transformations, but the ideas they entertained of
them were very imperfect and often erroneous. The changes are
produced in so sudden a manner, that they seem like the metamorphoses
recorded in the fables of the ancients, and it is not
improbable that those fables owe their origin to the transformation
of insects. It was not till towards the latter end of the last
century that any just conception of this subject was formed; the
mystery was then unveiled by those two great anatomists Malpighi
and Swammerdam, who observed these insects under every
appearance, and traced them through all their forms; by dissecting
them at the time just preceding their changes, they were
enabled to prove that the moth and butterfly grow and strengthen
themselves, that their members are formed and unfolded under<span class="pagenum" id="Page221">[221]</span>
the figure of the insect we call a caterpillar, and that the
growth was effected by a developement of parts; they also shewed
that it is not difficult to exhibit in these all the parts of the future
moth, as its wings, legs, antenn&aelig;, &amp;c. and consequently that the
changes which are apparently sudden to our eyes, are gradually
formed under the skin of the animal, and only appear sudden to
us, because the insect then gets rid of a case which had before
concealed its real members. By this case it is preserved from
injuries, till its wings, and every other part of its delicate frame
are in a condition to bear the impulse of the sun, and the action
of the air naked; when all the parts are grown firm, and ready
to perform their several offices, the perfect animal appears in the
form of its parent. Though these discoveries dissipated the false
wonders of the metamorphoses that the world before believed,
they created a fund of real admiration by the discovery of the
truth. These transformations clearly prove, that without experience
every thing in nature would appear a mystery; so much
so, that a person unacquainted with the transformation of the
caterpillar to the chrysalis, and of this to the fly, would consider
them as three distinct species; for who, by the mere light of nature,
or the powers of reason unaided by experience, could believe
that a butterfly, adorned with four beautiful wings, furnished
with a long spiral proboscis or tongue, instead of a mouth, and
with six legs, proceeded from a disgusting hairy caterpillar, provided
with jaws and teeth, and fourteen feet? Without experience,
who could imagine that a long white smooth soft worm
hid under the earth, should be transformed into a black crustaceous
beetle? Nor could any one, from considering them in their
perfect state, have discovered the relation which they bear to the
several changes of state, and their corresponding forms, through
which they have passed, and which are to appearance as distinct
as difference can make them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page222">[222]</span></p>

<p>The life of those insects which pass through these various
changes, may be divided into four principal parts, each of which
will be found truly worthy of the utmost attention of the microscopic
observer.</p>

<p>The first change is from the <span class="smcapall">EGG</span> into the <span class="smcapall">LARVA</span>, or, as it is
more generally called, into the worm or caterpillar. From the
<span class="smcapall">LARVA</span>, it passes into the <span class="smcapall">PUPA</span>, or chrysalis state. From the
<span class="smcapall">PUPA</span>, into the <span class="smcapall">IMAGO</span>, or fly state.</p>

<p>Few subjects can be found that are more expressive of the extensive
goodness of Divine Providence, than these transformations,
in which we find the occasional and temporary parts and
organs of these little animals suited and adapted with the most
minute exactness to the immediate manner and convenience of
their existence; which again are shifted and changed, upon the
insects commencing a new scene and state of action. In its larva
state the insect appears groveling, heavy, and voracious, in the
form of a worm, with a long body composed of successive rings;
crawling along by the assistance of these, or small little hooks,
which are placed on the side of the body. Its head is armed with
strong jaws, its eyes smooth, entirely deprived of sex, the blood
circulating from the hind part towards the head. It breathes
through small apertures, which are situated on each side of the
body, or through one or more tubes placed in the hinder part
thereof. While it is in the larva state, the insect is as it were
masked, and its true appearance concealed; for under this mask
the more perfect form is hidden from the human eye. In the
pupa, or chrysalis state, the insect may be compared to a child in
swaddling cloathes; its members are all folded together under
the breast, and inclosed within one or more coverings, remaining
there without motion. While in this state, no insects but those of<span class="pagenum" id="Page223">[223]</span>
the hemiptera class, take any nourishment. The change is effected
various ways; in some insects the skin of the larva opens,
and leaves a passage, with all its integuments; in others, the skin
hardens and becomes a species of cone, which entirely conceals
the insect; others form or spin cones for themselves, and in this
state they remain till the parts have acquired sufficient firmness,
and are ready to perform their several offices.</p>

<p>The insect then casts off the spoils of its former state, wakes
from a death-like inactivity, breaks as it were the inclosures of
the tomb, throws off the dusky shroud, and appears in its imago
or perfect form; for it has now attained the state of organical
perfection, which answers to the rank it is to hold in the
corporeal world: the structure of the body, the alimentary organs,
and those of motion, are materially changed. It is now
furnished with wings magnificently adorned, soars above and
despises its former pursuits, wafts the soft air, chooses its mate,
and transmits its nature to a succeeding race. Those members,
which in the preceding state were wrapped up, soft, and motionless,
now display themselves, grow strong, and are put in exercise.
The interior changes are as considerable as those of the exterior
form, and that in proportion as the first state differs from the
last; some organs acquire greater strength and firmness, others are
rendered more delicate; some are suppressed, and some unfolded,
which did not seem to exist in the former stages of its life.</p>

<h4>OF THE LARVA STATE OF INSECTS.</h4>

<p>As the larv&aelig; or caterpillars of the moth and butterfly<a href="#Footnote63" id="FNanchor63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> form
the most numerous family among the tribe of insects, I shall first<span class="pagenum" id="Page224">[224]</span>
describe them, and their various changes from this state to their
last and perfect form, and then proceed to those insects which
differ most from the caterpillar in one or all of their various
changes.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote63"><a href="#FNanchor63" class="label">[63]</a> Butterflies are
distinguished from moths by the time of their flying abroad, and by their
antenn&aelig;; the butterflies appear by day, their antenn&aelig; are generally terminated by a little knob;
the moths fly mostly in the evening, and their antenn&aelig; are either setaceous or pectinated.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The greater part of those insects which come forth in spring or
summer, perish or disappear at the approach of winter; there are
very few, the period of whose life exceeds that of a year; some
survive the rigours of winter, being concealed and buried under
ground; many are hid in the bark of trees, and others in the
chinks of old walls; some, like the caterpillar of the brown-tailed
moth,<a href="#Footnote64" id="FNanchor64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> at the approach of winter not only secure and strengthen
the web in which the society inhabit, and thus protect themselves
from impertinent intruders, but each individual also spins
a case for itself, where it rests in torpid security, notwithstanding
the inclemency of the season, till the spring animates it afresh,
and informs it, that the all-bountiful Author of nature has provided
food convenient for it. Many that are hatched in the
autumn retire and live under the earth during the winter months,
but in the spring come out, feed, and proceed onward to their
several changes; while no small part pass the colder months in
their chrysalis or pupa state: but the greater number of the caterpillar
race remain in the egg, being carefully deposited by the
parent fly in those places where they will be hatched with the
greatest safety and success; in this state the latent principle of
life is preserved till the genial influences of the spring call it into
action, and bring forth the young insect to share the banquet that
nature has provided.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote64"><a href="#FNanchor64" class="label">[64]</a> This moth was
uncommonly numerous and destructive near London in the year 1782,
and, aided by the predictions of an empirical imposter, occasioned a considerable alarm in the
minds of the ignorant and superstitious. The judicious publication of a short history of the
insect, by Mr. Curtis, in some measure contributed to dissipate their fears. <span class="smcap">Edit.</span></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page225">[225]</span></p>

<p>All caterpillars are hatched from the egg, and when they first
proceed from it are generally small and feeble, but grow in
strength as they increase in size. The body is divided into twelve
rings; the head is connected with the first, and is hard and crustaceous.
No caterpillar of the moth or butterfly has less than
eight, or more than sixteen feet; the six first are crustaceous,
pointed, and fixed to the three first rings of the body; these feet
are the covering to the six future feet of the moth; the other six
feet are soft and flexible or membranaceous; they vary both in
figure and number, and are proper only to the larva state; with
respect to their external figure, they are either smooth or hairy,
soft to the touch, or hard like shagreen, beautifully adorned with
a great variety of the most lively teints; on each side of the body
nine little oval holes are placed, which are generally considered
as the organs of respiration. There are on each side of the head
of the caterpillar five or six little black spots, which are supposed
to be its eyes. These creatures vary in size, from half an inch
long to four and five inches.</p>

<p>The caterpillar, whose life is one continued succession of
changes, often moults its skin before it attains its full growth;
not one of them arrives at perfection, without having cast its
skin at least once or twice. These changes are the more remarkable,
because when the caterpillar moults, it is not simply
the skin that is changed; for we find in the exuvia, the skull, the
jaws, and all the exterior parts, both scaly and membranaceous,
which compose its upper and under lip, its antenn&aelig;, palpi, and
even those crustaceous pieces within the head, which serve as a
fixed basis to a number of muscles; we further find in the exuvia,
the spiracula, the claws, and sheaths of the anterior limbs, and
in general all that is visible of the caterpillar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page226">[226]</span></p>

<p>The new organs were under the old ones as in a sheath, so that
the caterpillar effects the changes by withdrawing itself from
the old skin, when it finds itself lodged in too narrow a compass.
But to produce this change, to push off the old covering, and
bring forward the new, is a work of labour and time. Those caterpillars
who live in society, and have a kind of nest or habitation,
retire there to change their skins, fixing the hooks of the
feet, during the operation, firmly in the web of their nest. Some
of the solitary species spin at this time a slender web, to which
they affix themselves. A day or two before the critical moment
approaches, the insect ceases to eat, and loses its usual activity;
in proportion as the time of change advances, the colour of the
caterpillar becomes more feeble, the skin hardens and withers,
and is soon incapable of receiving those juices by which it was
heretofore nourished and supported. The insect may now be
seen, at distant intervals, to elevate its back, and stretch itself to
its utmost extent; sometimes to lift up the head, move it a little
from side to side, and then let it fall again; near the change, the
second and third rings are seen to swell considerably; by these
internal efforts the old parts are stretched and distended as much
as possible, an operation which is attended with great difficulty,
as the new parts are all weak and tender. However, by repeated
exertions, all the vessels which conveyed the nourishment
to the exterior skin are disengaged, and cease to act, and a slit is
made on the back, generally beginning at the second or third
ring; the new skin may now be just perceived, being distinguished
by the freshness and brightness of its colour; the caterpillar
then presses the body like a wedge into this slit, by
which means it is soon opened from the first down to the fourth
ring; this renders it large enough to afford the insect a passage,
which it soon effects in a very curious manner. The caterpillar
generally fasts a whole day after each moulting, for it is necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page227">[227]</span>
that the parts should acquire a certain degree of consistency, before
it can live and act in its usual manner; many also perish
under the operation. The body having grown under the old skin,
till the insect was become too large for it, it always appears
much larger after it has quitted the exuvia: now as the growth
was gradual, and the parts soft, the skin pressed them together,
so that they lay in a small space; but as soon as the skin is cast
off, they are as it were liberated from their bonds, and distend
themselves considerably. Some caterpillars, in changing their
skin, from smooth, become covered with fine hair; while others,
that were covered with this fine hair, have the last skin smooth.<a href="#Footnote65" id="FNanchor65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
The silk-worm, previous to its chrysalis or pupa state, casts its
skin four times; the first is cast on the tenth, eleventh, or twelfth
day, according to the nature of the season; the second, in five or
six days after; the third in five or six days more, and the fourth
and last in six or seven days after the third.</p>

<p>Before we describe the change of the larva into the pupa state,
it will be necessary to give the reader an account of those names
by which entomologists distinguish the different appearances of the
insect in its pupa state. It is called Coarctata, when it is straitened
or confined to a case of a globular form, without the smallest resemblance
to the structure of the insect it contains, as in the diptera.
It is called Obtecta, disguised or shrouded, when the insect
is inveloped in a crustaceous covering, consisting of two parts, one
of which surrounds the head and thorax, the other the abdomen.
It is termed Incompleta, when the pupa has perceptible wings
and feet, but cannot move them, as in most of the hymenoptera.
Semicompleta; these can walk or run, but have only the rudiments<span class="pagenum" id="Page228">[228]</span>
of wings. The difference between the pupa and the larva
of this class is very inconsiderable, as they eat, walk, and act, just
as they did in their primitive state; the only remarkable difference
is a kind of case which contains the wings that are to be
developed in their fly state. Completa; those designed by this
name take their perfect form at their birth, and do not pass, like
other insects, through a variety of states, though they often
change their skin.</p>

<p>It is a general rule, that all winged insects pass through the
larva and pupa state, before they assume their perfect form: there
are also insects which have no wings, and yet undergo similar
transformations, as the bed bug, the flea, &amp;c. Other insects,
which have no wings, and which always remain without them,
never pass through the pupa state, but are subject to considerable
changes, as well with respect to the number, as the figure of
their parts; thus mites have four pair of feet, and two smaller
ones at the fore part of the body, near the head; yet some of
these are born with only three pair of feet, the fourth is not perceived
till some time after their birth.<a href="#Footnote66" id="FNanchor66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> The figure of the monoculus
quadricornis of Linn&aelig;us (Fauna Suecica, edit. Stockholm,
1761, No. 2049) changes considerably after its birth.<a href="#Footnote67" id="FNanchor67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
The julus is an insect with a great number of feet, some species
having an hundred pair and upwards. M. De Geer has given
a description of one with more than two-hundred pair,<a href="#Footnote68" id="FNanchor68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> and yet
these at their birth have only three pair, the rest are not perceived
till some time after.</p>

<h4>OF THE CHANGE FROM THE LARVA TO THE PUPA STATE.</h4>

<p>I shall now return to the caterpillar, and take notice of the
care and provision it makes to pass from the larva state into
that of the pupa or chrysalis; which is, in general, a state of
imperfection, inactivity, and weakness, through which the insect,
when it has obtained a proper size, must pass; and in which it
remains often for months, sometimes for a whole year, exposed,
without any means of escaping, to every event; and in which it
receives the necessary preparations for its perfect state, and is
enabled once more to appear upon the transitory scene of time.
During its passage from one state to the other, as well as when
it is in the pupa form, the microscopical observer will find many
opportunities of exercising his instrument.</p>

<p>The transitions of the caterpillar from one state to another, are
to it a subject of the most interesting nature; for in passing
through them, it often runs the risk of losing its life, that precious
boon of heaven, which is ever accompanied with a degree
of delight, proportioned to the state in which the creature exists,
and the use it makes of the gift it has received. If the caterpillar
could therefore foresee the efforts and exertions it must
make to put off its present form, and the state of weakness and
impotence under which it must exist while in the pupa state,
it would undoubtedly choose the most convenient place, and the
most advantageous situation, for the performance of this arduous
operation; one where it would be the least exposed to danger, at
a time when it had neither strength to resist, nor swiftness to
avoid the attack of an enemy. All these necessary instructions
the caterpillar receives from the influence of an all-regulating
Providence, which conveys the proper information to it by its
own sensations: hence, when the critical period approaches, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page230">[230]</span>
proceeds as if it knew what would be the result of its operations.
Different species prepare themselves for the change different ways,
suited to their nature and the length of time they are to remain
in this state.</p>

<p>When the caterpillar has attained to its full growth, and the
parts of the future butterfly are sufficiently formed beneath its
skin, it prepares for its change into the pupa state; it seeks for a
proper place in which to perform the important business: the
different methods employed by these little animals to secure this
state of rest, may be reduced to four: 1. Some spin webs or
cones, in which they inclose themselves. 2. Others conceal
themselves in little cells, which they form under ground. 3. Some
suspend themselves by their posterior extremity; 4. While others
are suspended by a girdle that goes round their body. I shall
describe the variety in these, as well as the industry used in constructing
them, after we have gone through the manner in which
the caterpillar prepares itself for, and passes through the pupa
state.</p>

<p>Preparatory to the change, it ceases to take any food, empties
itself of all the excrementitious matter that is contained in the
intestines, voiding at the same time the membrane which served
as a lining to these and the stomach. The intestinal canal is
composed of two principal tubes, the one inserted into the other;
the external tube is compact and fleshy, the internal one is thin
and transparent; it is the inner tube, which lines the stomach
and intestines, that is voided with the excrement before the
change. It generally perseveres in a state of rest and inactivity
for several days, which affords the external and internal organs
that are under the skin an opportunity of gradually unfolding
themselves. In proportion as the change into the pupa form approaches,
the body is observed often to extend and contract itself;<span class="pagenum" id="Page231">[231]</span>
the hinder part is that which is first disengaged from the
caterpillar skin; when this part of the body is free, the animal
contracts and draws it up towards the head; it then liberates
itself in the same manner from the two succeeding rings, consequently
the insect is now lodged in the fore part of its caterpillar
covering; the half which is abandoned remains flaccid and empty,
while the fore part is swoln and distended. The animal, by
strong efforts, still forcing itself against the fore part of the skin,
bursts the skull into three pieces, and forms a longitudinal opening
in the three first rings of the body; through this it proceeds,
drawing one part after the other, by alternately lengthening and
shortening, swelling and contracting the body and different rings;
or else, by pushing back the exuvia, gets rid of its odious reptile
form.</p>

<p>The caterpillar, thus stripped from its skin, is what we call the
pupa, chrysalis, or aurelia, in which the parts of the future moth
are inclosed in a crustaceous covering, but are so soft, that the
slightest touch will discompose them. The exterior part of the
chrysalis is at first exceedingly tender, soft, and partly transparent,
being covered with a viscous fluid; this soon dries up,
thickens, and forms a new covering for the animal, capable of
resisting external injuries; a case, which is at the same time the
sepulchre of the caterpillar, and the cradle of the moth; where, as
under a veil, this wonderful transformation is carried on.</p>

<p>The pupa has been called a chrysalis, or creature made of gold,
from the resplendent yellow colour with which some kinds are
adorned. Reaumur has shewn us whence they derive this rich
colour; that it proceeds from two skins, the upper one a beautiful
brown, which lies upon or covers a highly polished and smooth
white skin: the light reflected from the last, in passing through,
gives it the golden yellow, in the same manner as this colour is<span class="pagenum" id="Page232">[232]</span>
often given to leather; so that the whole appears gilt, although
no gold enters into the tincture. The chrysalis of the common
white butterfly furnishes a most beautiful object for the lucernal
opake microscope.</p>

<p>Those who are desirous to discover distinctly the various members
of the moth in the pupa, should examine it before the fore-mentioned
fluid is dried up, when it will be found to be only the
moth with the members glued together; these, by degrees, acquire
sufficient force to break their covering, and disengage themselves
from the bands which confine them. While in this state,
all the parts of the moth may be traced out, though so folded
and laid together, that it cannot make any use of them; nor is
it expedient that it should, as they are too soft and tender to be
used, and pass through this state merely to be hardened and
strengthened.</p>

<p>To examine the moth concealed under the skin of a caterpillar,
one of them should be taken at the last change; when the skin
begins to open, it should be drowned in spirit of wine, or some
strong liquor, and be left therein for some days, that it may take
more consistency and harden itself; the skin of the caterpillar
may then be easily removed: the chrysalis, or feeble moth, will
be first discovered, after which the tender moth may be traced
out, and its wings, legs, antenn&aelig;, &amp;c. may be opened and displayed
by an accurate observer.</p>

<p>The parts of the moth or butterfly are not disposed exactly in
the same manner in the body of the caterpillar, as when left
naked in the chrysalis. The wings are longer and narrower,
being wound up into the form of a cord, and the antenn&aelig; are
rolled up on the head; the tongue is also twisted up and laid
upon the head, but in a very different manner from what it is in<span class="pagenum" id="Page233">[233]</span>
the perfect animal, and different from that which it lies in within
the chrysalis; so that it is by a progressive and gradual change,
that the interior parts are prepared for the pupa and moth state.
The eggs, hereafter to be deposited by the moth, are also to be
found, not only in the chrysalis, but in the caterpillar itself, arranged
in their natural and regular order.</p>

<p>While in this state, the creature generally remains immoveable,
and seems to have no other business but patiently to attend the
time of its change, which depends on the parts becoming hard
and firm, and the transpiration of that humidity which keeps
them soft; the powers of life are as it were absorbed in a deep
sleep; the organs of sensation seem obliterated, being imprisoned
by coverings more or less strong, the greater part remains fixed
in those situations which the caterpillar had selected for them till
their final metamorphosis; some, however, are capable of changing
place, but their movements are slow and painful.</p>

<p>The time, therefore, which the moth or butterfly remains in the
pupa state is not always the same, varying in different species,
and depending also upon the warmth of the weather, and other
adventitious circumstances; some remain in that situation for a
few weeks; others do not attain their perfect form for eight,
nine, or eleven months: this often depends on the season in which
they assume the pupa form, or rather on the time of their birth.
Some irregularities are also occasioned by the different temperature
of the air, by which they are retarded or accelerated, so as
to be brought forward in the season best suited to their nature
and the ends of their existence. I have heard of an instance,
where the pupa, produced from caterpillars of the same eggs,
nourished in the same manner, and which all spun up within a
few days of each other in the autumn, came into the fly state at
three different and distant periods; viz. one-third of them the<span class="pagenum" id="Page234">[234]</span>
spring following their change, one-third more the succeeding
spring, and the remainder the spring after, making three years
from their first hatching; a further and manifest proof of the
beauty and wisdom of the laws of Divine order, which are continually
operating for the best interests of all created beings. As
the transformation of insects is retarded by cold, and accelerated
by heat, the ordinary period of these changes may sometimes be
altered, by placing them in different degrees of heat or cold; by
these they may be awakened sooner to a new state of existence,
or kept in one of profound sleep.<a href="#Footnote69" id="FNanchor69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>There are some caterpillars which remain in their cone eight or
nine months before they acquire the complete pupa state; so
that their duration in that form is much shorter than it naturally
appears to be.</p>

<h4>OF THE PREPARATION OF THE CATERPILLAR FOR THE
METAMORPHOSES.</h4>

<p>The industry of the caterpillar, in securing itself for its change
into the chrysalis, must not be passed by; not only because it
naturally leads the reader to consider and admire that divine
agency, by which the insect is informed, but because the different
modes it makes use of cannot be properly investigated, without
the assistance of glasses, it therefore consequently becomes a
proper subject for the microscope; we shall select from a great
variety, a few instances, to animate the reader in these researches.</p>

<p>Some caterpillars, towards the time of their change, suspend
themselves from the branch of a tree, with the head downwards;
in this position they assume the pupa form, and from thence immerge<span class="pagenum" id="Page235">[235]</span>
a butterfly or moth. In order to secure itself in this
position, the insect covers with threads that part of the branch
from which it means to suspend itself; it places these in different
directions, and then covers them with other threads, laying on
several successive thicknesses, each new layer being smaller in
size than that which preceded it; forming, when finished, a little
cone or hillock of silk, as will be found when examined by the
microscope. The caterpillar hooks itself by the hinder feet to
this hillock, and when it has found by several trials that it is
strongly fixed thereto, throws itself forward, letting the body
fall with the head downwards. Soon after it is thus suspended,
it bends the fore part of the body, keeping this bent posture for
some time, then straitening the body, again in a little time bending
it, and so on, repeating this operation till it has formed a slit
in the skin upon the back; part of the pupa soon forces itself
through this, and extends the slit as far as the last crustaceous
feet; the pupa then forces upwards the skin, as we would push
down a stocking, by means of its little hooks and the motion of
the body, till it has slipped it off to that part from which the caterpillar
had suspended itself. But the pupa has still to disengage
itself from this small packet, to which the exuvia is now
reduced: here the observer will find himself interested for the
little animal, anxious to learn how the pupa will quit this skin,
and how it will be enabled to fix itself to the hillock, as it has
neither arms nor legs. A little attention soon explains the operation,
and extricates the observer from his embarrassment. It
seizes the exuvia by the rings of the body, and thus holds itself
as it were by a pair of pincers; then, by bending the tail, it frees
itself from the old skin, and by the same method soon suspends
itself to the silken mount; it lengthens out the hinder part of
the body, and clasps, by means of its rings, the various foldings
of the exuvia, one after another; thus creeping backward on the
spoils, till it can reach the hillock with the tail; which, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page236">[236]</span>
examined by the microscope, will be found to be furnished with
hooks to fix itself by. It is surprizing to see with what exactness
and ease these insects perform an operation so delicate and dangerous,
which is only executed once in their lives; and nought
else can account for it, but the consideration that <span class="smcapall">HE</span>, who designed
that the caterpillar should pass through these changes, had
provided means for that end, regularly connecting the greater
steps by intermediate ones, the desire of extending their species
forming and acting upon the organization, till the purposes of
their life are completed. Different kinds of these insects require
variety in the mode of suspension; some fix themselves in an
horizontal position, by a girdle which they tie round their body;
this girdle appears to the naked eye as a single thread; when
examined with the microscope, it will be found to be an assemblage
of fine threads, lying close to each other, so fixed as to
support the caterpillar, and yet leave it in full freedom to effect
the changes. Like the preceding kind, it fixes the girdle to the
branch of a tree; in this situation it remains for some time motionless,
and then begins to bend, move, and agitate its body in a
very singular manner, till it has opened the exterior covering,
which it pushes off and removes much in the same manner as
we have described in the preceding article, and yet with such
dexterity, that the pupa remains suspended by the same girdle.</p>

<h4>OF THE IMAGO OR FLY STATE OF INSECTS.</h4>

<p>As soon as the moth acquires sufficient strength to break the
bonds which surround it, and of which it is informed by its internal
sensations, it makes a powerful effort to escape from its
prison, and view the world with new-formed eyes. The moth
frees itself from the pupa with much greater ease than the pupa
from the caterpillar; for the case of the pupa becomes so dry,
when the moth is near the time of throwing off its covering, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page237">[237]</span>
it will break to pieces if it be only gently pressed between the
fingers; and very few of the parts will be found, on examination,
to adhere to the body. Hence, when the insect has acquired a
proper degree of solidity, it does not require any great exertion
to split the membrane which covers it. A small degree of motion,
or a little inflation of the body, is sufficient for this purpose;
these motions reiterated a few times, enlarge the hole, and afford
the moth room to escape from its confinement. The opening
through which they pass is always at the same part of the skin,
a little above the trunk, between the wings, and a small piece
which covers the head; the different fissures are generally made in
the same direction. If the outer case be opened, it is easy to discover
the efforts the insect makes to emancipate itself from its
shell; when the operation begins, there seems to be a violent agitation
in the humours contained in the little animal; the fluids
seem to be driven with rapidity through all the vessels, and
it is seen to agitate its legs, &amp;c. as it were struggling to get
free; these efforts soon break its brittle skin. The loosening
the exterior bands of the pupa is not the only difficulty many
moths have to encounter with; it has often also to pierce
the cone or case in which it has been inclosed, and that at a
time when its members are very feeble, when it is no longer
furnished with strong jaws to pierce and cut its way through;
but by the regular laws of divine order, means are furnished to
every creature of attaining the end for which it was produced:
thus, in the present case, some of these insects are provided with
a liquor with which they soften and weaken the end of the cone;
some leave one end feeble, and close it only with a few threads,
so that a slight effort of the head enables the moth to burst the
prison doors, and immerge into day.</p>

<p>When the moth first sees the day, it is humid and moist; but
this humidity soon evaporates, the interior parts dry and harden<span class="pagenum" id="Page238">[238]</span>
as well as the exterior; the wings, which are wrinkled, being
thick and small, then extend themselves, strengthen and harden
insensibly, and the fibres which were at first flexible, become hard
and stiff; so much so, that Malpighi considered them as bones:
in proportion as these fibres harden, the fluid which circulates
within them, and extends the wings, loses its force; so that if
any extraneous circumstance prevent the motion of this fluid, at
the first instant of the moth&#8217;s escape from its former state, the
wings will then become ill-shaped; often expanding with such
rapidity, that the naked eye cannot trace their unfolding. The
wings, which were scarce half the length of the body, acquire in
a few minutes their full size, so as to be nearly five times as large
as they were before: nor is it the wings only which are thus
increased; all their spots and colours, heretofore so minute as to
be scarce discernible, are proportionably extended, so that what
before appeared as only so many unmeaning and confused points,
become distinct and beautiful ornaments; and those that are furnished
with a tongue or trunk, curl and coil it up. When the
wings are unfolded, the tongue rolled up, the moth sufficiently
dried, and the different members strengthened, it takes its flight.
Most of them, soon after they have attained their perfect state,
void an excrementitious substance; Reaumur thinks that they
eject very little, if any, during the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>In the progress of these insects, such changes take place, as we
could have formed no conception of, if the great Author of these
wonders had not been pleased to reward the industrious naturalist
with the discovery.</p>

<p>If the moth be opened down the belly, and the unctuous parts
which fill it, be removed, the gross artery, which has been called
the heart, will be visible, and the contractions and dilatations, by
which it pushes forward the liquor it contains, may be easily observed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page239">[239]</span>
One of the most remarkable circumstances is, that the
circulation of this fluid in the moth is directly contrary to that
which took place in the caterpillar; in this, the liquor moved
from the tail to the head, whereas in the moth, it moves from the
head to the tail; so that the fluid which answers the purposes of
the blood in the moth, goes from the superior, towards the inferior
parts, but in the voracious sensual caterpillar, the order is
inverted, it proceeds from the inferior towards the superior parts;
all its members, formerly soft, inactive, and folded up under an
envelope, are expanded, strengthened, and exposed to observation.</p>

<p>The food of the caterpillar is gross and solid, and even this it
is obliged to earn with much labour and danger; but, when freed
as it were from the jaws of death, and arrived at its perfect form,
the purest nectar is its potion, and the air its element. It was
supplied with coarse food, in the first state, by the painful operation
of its teeth, which was afterwards digested by a violent trituration
of the stomach. The intestines are now formed in a
more delicate manner, and suited to a more pure and elegant
aliment, which nature has prepared for its use from the most
fragrant and beautiful flowers. Many internal parts of the caterpillar
disappear in the chrysalis, and many that could not be perceived
before, are now rendered visible: the interior changes are
not less surprizing than those of the exterior form, and are, properly
speaking, creative of them; for it is from these the exterior
form originates, and with these it always corresponds. In a word,
the creature that heretofore crept upon the earth, now flies freely
through the air; and far from creating our aversion by its frightful
prickles and foul appearance, it attracts our notice by the most
elegant shape and apparel, and, from being scarce able to move
from one shrub to another, acquires strength and agility to tower
far above the tallest inhabitant of the forest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page240">[240]</span></p>

<h3>OF THE SILK-WORM.</h3>

<p>The industry of those that spin cones or cases, in which they
inclose themselves, in order to prepare for their transformation
in security, is more generally known, as it is from one species of
these that we derive so many benefits, namely from the silk-worm,
whose works afford an ornament for greatness, and add
magnificence to royalty. All caterpillars undergo similar changes
with it, and many in the butterfly state greatly exceed it in
beauty: but the golden tissue, in which the silk-worm wraps itself,
far surpasses the silky threads of all the other kinds; they
may indeed come forth with a variety of colours, and wings bedecked
with gold and scarlet, yet they are but the beings of a
summer&#8217;s day; both their life and beauty quickly vanish, and
leave no remembrance after them; but the silk-worm leaves behind
it such beneficial monuments, as at once record the wisdom
of its Creator, and his bounty to man.<a href="#Footnote70" id="FNanchor70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote70"><a href="#FNanchor70" class="label">[70]</a> Pullein on the Culture of Silk.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The substance of which the silk is formed, is a fine yellow
transparent gum, contained in two reservoirs that wind about the
intestines, and which, when they are unfolded, are about ten
inches long; they terminate in two exceeding small orifices near
the mouth, through which the silk is drawn, or spun to the degree
of fineness which its occasions may require. This apparatus
has been compared to the instrument used by wire-drawers, and
by which gold and silver is drawn to any degree of minuteness.
From each of these reservoirs proceeds a thread, which are united
afterwards; so that if it be examined by the microscope, it will
be found to consist of two cylinders or threads glued together,
with a groove in the middle; a separation may sometimes be
perceived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page241">[241]</span></p>

<p>When the silk-worm has found a convenient situation, it sets
to work, first spinning some random threads, which serve to support
the future superstructure; upon these it forms an oval of a
loose texture, consisting of what is called the floss-silk; within
this it forms a firm and more consistent ball of silk, remaining
during the whole business within the circumference of the spheroid
that it is forming, resting on its hinder parts, and with its
mouth and fore legs directing and fastening the threads. These
threads are not directed in a regular circular form, but are spun
in different spots, in an infinite number of zig-zag lines; so that
when it is wound off, it proceeds in a very irregular manner,
sometimes from one side of the cone, then from the other. This
thread, when measured, has been found to be about three-hundred
yards long, and so fine, that eight or ten are generally rolled
off into one by the manufacturers. The silk-worm usually employs
about three days in finishing this cone; the inside is generally
smeared with a kind of gum, that is designed to keep out
the rain: in this cone it assumes the pupa form, and remains
therein from fifteen to thirty days, according to the warmth of
the climate. When the moth is formed, it moistens the end of
this cone, and by frequent motions of the head loosens the texture
of the silk, so as to form a hole without breaking it.</p>

<p>When the silk-worm has acquired its perfect growth, the reservoirs
of silk are full, and it is pressed by its sensations to get rid
of this incumbrance, and accordingly spins a cone, the altitude
and size of which are proportioned to its wants: by traversing
backwards and forwards, it is relieved, and attains by an innate
desire the end for which it was formed; and thus a caterpillar,
whose form is rather disgusting to the human unphilosophic eye,
becomes a considerable object of manufacture and trade, a source
of wealth, and, from the extensive employment it affords, a blessing
to thousands. The size of the cone is not always proportioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page242">[242]</span>
to that of the caterpillar; some that are small construct
larger cones than others which exceed them in bulk.</p>

<p>There is a caterpillar which forms its silken cone in the shape
of a boat turned bottom upwards, whence it is called by Reaumur
the &#8220;coque en batteau;&#8221; the construction is complicated,
and seems to require more art than is usually attributed to this
insect. It consists of two principal parts, shaped like shells,
which are united with considerable skill and propriety; each shell
or side is framed by itself, and formed of an innumerable quantity
of minute silk rings; in the fore part there is a projection, in
which a small crevice may be perceived, which serves, when
opened, for the escape of the moth; the sides are connected with
so much art, that they open and shut as if framed with springs;
so that the cone, from which the butterfly has escaped, appears
as close as that which is still inhabited.</p>

<p>Those caterpillars which are not furnished with a silky cone,
supply that want with various materials, which they possess sufficient
skill to form into a proper habitation, to secure them while
preparing for the perfect state; some construct theirs with leaves
and branches, tying them fast together, and then strengthening
the connection; others connect these leaves with great regularity;
many strip themselves of their hairs, and form a mixture of hair
and silk; others construct a cone of sand, or earth, cementing the
particles with a kind of glue; some gnaw the wood into a kind
of saw-dust, and glue it together; with an innumerable variety of
modes suited to their present and future state.</p>

<h3>OF THE BEETLE.</h3>

<p>To make the reader more fully acquainted with a subject
which affords such abundant matter for the exercise of his microscope,<span class="pagenum" id="Page243">[243]</span>
I shall proceed to describe, in as concise a manner as I
am able, the changes of a few insects of different classes, beginning
with the beetle.</p>

<p>The beetle is of the first or coleopterous class, having four
wings. The two upper ones are crustaceous, and form a case to
the lower ones; when they are shut, there is a longitudinal suture
down the back: this formation of the wings is necessary, as the
beetle often lives under the surface of the earth, in holes which
it digs by its own industry and strength. These cases save
the real wings from the damage which they might otherwise
sustain, by rubbing or crushing against the sides of its abode;
they serve also to keep the wings clean, and produce a buzzing
noise when the animal rises in the air. The strength of this insect
is astonishing; it has been estimated that, bulk for bulk,
their muscles are a thousand times stronger than those of a man!</p>

<p>The beetle is only an insect disengaged from the pupa form;
the pupa is a transformation in like manner from the worm or
larva, and this proceeds from the egg; so that here, as in the foregoing
instances, one insect is exhibited in four different states of life,
after passing through three of which, and the various inconveniences
attendant on them, it is advanced to a more perfect state.
When a larva, it trains a miserable existence under the earth; in
the pupa form it is deprived of motion, and as it were dead; but
the beetle itself lives at pleasure above and under ground, and
also in the air, enjoying a higher degree of life, which it has attained
by slow progression, after passing through difficulties, affliction,
and death.</p>

<p>If we judge of the rank which the beetle holds in the scale of
animation, from the places where they are generally found, from
the food which nourishes them, from the disgusting and odious<span class="pagenum" id="Page244">[244]</span>
forms of many, from their antipathy to light, and their delight in
darkness, we shall not form great ideas of the dignity of their
situation. But as all things are rendered subservient to the laws
of divine order, it is sufficient for us to contemplate the wonders
that are displayed in this and every other organ of life, for the
reception of which, from the <span class="smcapall">FOUNTAIN AND SOURCE OF ALL
LIFE</span>, each individual is adapted, and that in a manner corresponding
to the state of existence it is to enjoy, and the energies
it is called forth to represent.</p>

<p>The egg of the rhinoceros beetle<a href="#Footnote71" id="FNanchor71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> is of an oblong round figure,
of a white colour; the shell thin, tender, and flexible; the teeth
of the worm that is within the shell come to perfection before
the other parts; so that as soon as it is hatched, it is capable of
devouring, and nourishing itself with the wood among which it
is placed. The larva or worm is curiously folded in the egg, the
tail resting between the teeth, which are disposed on each side
the belly; the worm in proper time breaks the shell, in the same
manner as a chicken, and crawls from thence to the next substance
suitable for its food. The worm, when it is hatched, is very
white, has six legs, and a wrinkled naked body, but the other
parts are all covered with hair; the head is then also bigger than
the whole body, a circumstance which may be observed in larger
animals, and which is founded on wise reasons.<a href="#Footnote72" id="FNanchor72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> If the egg be
observed from time to time while the insect is within it, the
beating of the heart may be perceived.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The eggs of the earth-worm, the snail, and the beetle, will
afford many subjects for the microscope, and will be found to
deserve a very attentive examination. Swammerdam was accustomed<span class="pagenum" id="Page245">[245]</span>
to hatch them in a dish, covered with white paper,
which he always kept in a moist state. To preserve these and
similar eggs, they must be pierced with a fine needle; the contained
liquors must be pressed out, after which they should be
blown up by means of a small glass tube, and then filled with a
little resin dissolved in oil of spike.</p>

<p>The worm of the rhinoceros beetle, like other insects in the
larva state, changes its skin; in order to effect which, it discharges
all its excrement, and forms a convenient hole in the
earth, in which it may perform the wonderful operation; for it
does not, like the serpent, cast off merely an external covering,
but the throat, a part of the stomach, and the inward surface of
the great gut, change at the same time their skin: as if it were
to increase the wonder, and to call forth our attention to these
representative changes, some hundreds of pulmonary pipes cast
also each its delicate skin, a transparent membrane is taken from
the eyes, and the skull remains fixed to the exuvia. After the
operation, the head and teeth are white and tender, though at
other times as hard as bone; so that the larva, when provoked,
will attempt to gnaw iron. For an accurate anatomical description
of this worm, I must refer the reader to Swammerdam; he
will find it, like the rest of this author&#8217;s works, well worthy of
his attentive perusal. To dissect it, he first killed it in spirit of
wine, or suffocated it in rain water rather more than lukewarm,
not taking it out from thence for some hours. This preparation
prevents an improper contraction of the muscular fibres.</p>

<p>When the time approaches for the worm to assume the pupa
form, it generally penetrates deeper into the ground,<a href="#Footnote73" id="FNanchor73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
or those<span class="pagenum" id="Page246">[246]</span>
places where it inhabits, to find a situation that it can more easily
suit to its subsequent process. Having found a proper place,
it forms with the hinder feet a polished cavity, in this it lies for
sometime immoveable; after which, by voiding excrementitious
substances, and by the evaporation of humidity, it becomes thinner
and shorter, the skin more furrowed and wrinkled, so that
it soon appears as if it were starved by degrees. If it be dissected
about this period, the head, the belly, and the thorax may
be clearly distinguished. While some external and internal parts
are changing by a slow accretion, others are gently distended by
the force of the blood and impelled humours. The body contracting
itself, while the blood is propelled towards the head,
forces the skull open in three parts, and the skin in the middle
of the back is separated, by means of an undulating motion of the
incisions of the back; at the same time the eyes, the horns, the
lips, &amp;c. cast their exuvia. During this operation, a thin watery
humour is diffused between the old and new skin, which renders
the separation easier. The process going on gradually, the worm
is at last disengaged from its skin, and the limbs and parts are,
by a continual unfolding, transformed into the pupa state; after
which, it twists and compresses the exuvia by the fundament,
and throws it towards the hinder part under the belly. The
pupa is at this time very delicate, tender, and flexible; and affords
a most astonishing appearance to an attentive observer.
Swammerdam thinks it is scarce to be equalled among the wonders
which are displayed in the insect part of the creation; in it
the future parts of the beetle are finely exhibited, so disposed and
formed, as soon to be able to serve the creature in a more perfect
state of life, and to put on a more elegant form.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote73"><a href="#FNanchor73" class="label">[73]</a> The larv&aelig; of
those beetles which live under ground are in general heavy, idle, and voracious;
on the contrary, the larv&aelig; which inhabit the waters are exceedingly active.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The pupa<a href="#Footnote74" id="FNanchor74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> of this insect weighs, a little after its change, much
heavier than it does in its beetle state; this is also the case with<span class="pagenum" id="Page247">[247]</span>
the pupa of the bee and hornet. The latter has been found to
weigh ten times as much as the hornet itself; this is probably
occasioned by a superabundant degree of moisture, by which
these insects are kept in a state of inactivity, which may be
compared to a kind of preternatural dropsy, till it is in some measure
dissipated; in proportion as this moisture is evaporated, the
skin hardens and dries: some days are required to exhale this
superfluous moisture. If the skin be taken off at this time, many
curious circumstances may be noted; but what claims our attention
most is, that the horn, which is so hard in the male beetle
when in a state of maturity, that it will bear to be sharpened
against a grindstone,<a href="#Footnote75" id="FNanchor75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> in the pupa state is quite soft, and more
like a fluid than a solid substance. How long the scene of mutation
continues is not known; some remain during the whole
winter, more particularly those which quit the larva state in autumn,
when a sudden cold checks their further operations, and
consequently they remain in a torpid state, without any food, for
several months. Some species of the beetle tribe go through all
the stages of their existence in a season, while others employ near
four years in the process, and live as winged insects a year.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>When the proper time for the final change arrives, all the muscular
parts grow strong, and are thus more able to shake off
their last integuments, which is performed exactly in the same
manner as in the passage of the insect from the larva to the pupa
state; so that in this last skin, which is extremely delicate, the
traces of the pulmonary tubes, that have been pulled off and
turned out, again become visible. All parts of the insect, and
more particularly the wings and their cases, are at this period
swelled and extended by the air and fluids which are driven into
them through the arteries and pulmonary tubes; the wings are<span class="pagenum" id="Page248">[248]</span>
now soft as wet paper, and the blood issues from them on the
least wound; but when they have acquired their proper consistency,
which in the elytra is very considerable, they do not exhibit
the least sign of any fluid within them, though cut or torn
almost asunder. The pupa being disengaged from its skin, assumes
a different form, in which it is dignified with the name of
a beetle, and acquires a distinction of sex, being either male or
female. The insect now begins to enjoy a life far preferable to
its former state of existence; from living in dirt and filth, under
briars and thorns, it raises itself towards the skies, plays in the
sun-beam, rejoices in its existence, and is nourished with the
oozing liquors of flowers.</p>

<h3>OF THE MUSCA CHAM&AElig;LEON.</h3>

<p>I shall now proceed to illustrate the nature of the different
transformations in insects, by giving an account of the musca
cham&aelig;leon. In the worm or larva condition it lives in the water,
breathes by the tail, and carries its legs within a little snout
near its mouth. When the time arrives for its pupa state, it
goes through the change without casting off the skin of the larva.
Lastly, in the imago, or fly state, it would infallibly perish in the
water, that element which had hitherto supplied it with life
and motion, was not the larva by nature instructed where to
choose a suitable situation for its approaching transformation.</p>

<p>This insect is characterized by Linn&aelig;us as &#8220;Musca cham&aelig;leon.
Habitat larva in aquis dulcibus; musca supra aquam obambulare
solet.&#8221; In a former edition of the Fauna Suecica he called it
oestrus aqu&aelig;; but on a more minute examination, he found it
was a musca; besides, the larv&aelig; of all known oestri are nourished
in the bodies of animals. The larva of this insect appears to consist
of twelve annular divisions, see <a href="#Plate11">Plate XI.</a> Fig. 1. by these it
is separated into a head, thorax, and abdomen; but as the stomach<span class="pagenum" id="Page249">[249]</span>
and intestines lie equally in the thorax and abdomen, it is
not easy to distinguish their limits until the insect approaches the
pupa state. The parts most worthy of notice are the tail and
snout. The tail is furnished with an elegant crown or circle of
hair b, disposed quite round it in an annular form; by means of
this the tail is supported on the surface of the water, while the
worm or larva is moving therein, the body in the mean while
hanging towards the bottom; it will sometimes remain in this
situation for a considerable time, without the least sensible motion.
When it is disposed to sink to the bottom by means of its
tail, it generally bends the hairs of that part towards each other
in the middle, but much closer towards the extremity; by these
means a hollow space is formed, and the bladder of air pent up
in it looks like a pearl, Fig. 2. <a href="#Plate11">Plate XI.</a> It is by the assistance
of this bubble, or little balloon, that the insect raises itself again
to the surface of the water. If this bubble escape, it can replace
it from the pulmonary tubes; sometimes large quantities of air
may be seen to arise in bubbles from the tail of the worm to the
surface of the water, and there mix with the incumbent atmosphere.
This operation may be easily seen by placing the worm
in a glass full of water, where it will afford a very entertaining
spectacle. The snout is divided into three parts, of which that
in the middle is immoveable; the two other parts grow from the
sides of the former; these are moveable, vibrating in a very singular
manner, like the tongues of lizards and serpents. The
greatest strength of the creature is fixed in these lateral parts of
the snout; it is on these that it walks when it is out of the water,
appearing, as it were to walk on its mouth, using it to assist motion,
as a parrot does its beak to climb, with greater advantage.</p>

<p>We shall now consider the external figure of this worm, as it
appears with the microscope. It is small toward the head, larger
about those parts which may be considered as the thorax; it then<span class="pagenum" id="Page250">[250]</span>
again diminishes, converging at the abdomen, and terminates in a
sharp tail, surrounded with hairs in the form of the rays of a star.</p>

<p>This worm, the head and tail included, has twelve annular
divisions, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, Fig. 3. <a href="#Plate11">Plate XI.</a>
Its skin resembles the covering of those animals that are provided
with a crustaceous habit, more than it does that of naked worms
or caterpillars; it is moderately hard, and like the rough skin
called shagreen, being thick set with a number of grains, evenly
distributed. The substance of the skin is firm and hard, and yet
very flexible. On each side of the body are nine spiracula or
holes, for the purpose of respiration; there are no such holes visible
on the tail ring <i>a</i>, nor on the third ring counting from the
head; for at the extremity of the tail there is an opening for the
admission and expulsion of air; in the third ring the spiracula are
very small, and appear only under the skin, near the place where
the embryo wings of the future fly are concealed. It is remarkable
that caterpillars, in general, have two rings without these
spiracula; perhaps, because they change into flies with four wings,
whereas this worm produces a fly that has only two. The skin
has three different shades of colour; it is adorned with oblong
black furrows, with spots of a light colour, and orbicular rings,
from which there generally springs a hair, as in the figure before
us, only the hair that grows on the insect&#8217;s side is represented;
besides this, there are here and there some other larger
hairs, c c. The difference of colour in this worm arises from the
quantity of grains in the same space; for in proportion as there is
a greater or lesser quantity of these, the furrows and rings are
of a deeper or paler colour. The head <i>d</i> is divided into three
parts, and covered with a skin, the grains on which are hardly
discernible. The eyes are rather protuberant, and lie forwards
near the snout. It has also two small horns i i, on the fore part
of the head. The snout is crooked, and ends in a sharp point as<span class="pagenum" id="Page251">[251]</span>
at f; but what is altogether singular and surprizing, though no
doubt wisely contrived by the great and almighty Architect, is,
that this insect&#8217;s legs are placed near the snout, between the sinuses,
in which the eyes are fixed. Each of these legs consists of
three joints, the outermost of which is covered with hard and
stiff hairs like bristles. From the next joint there springs a horny
bone h h, which the insect uses as a kind of thumb; the joint is
also of a black substance, between bone and horn in hardness;
the third joint is of the same nature. To distinguish these particulars,
the parts that form the upper sides of the mouth and the
eyes must be separated by means of a small fine knife; you may
then, by the assistance of the microscope, perceive that the leg is
articulated, by means of some particular ligaments, with that
portion of the insect&#8217;s mouth which answers to the lower jaw in
the human frame. We may then also discern the muscles which
serve to move the legs, and draw them up into a cavity that lies
between the snout and those parts of the mouth which are near
the horns i i.</p>

<p>This insect not only walks with these legs at the bottom of the
water, but even moves itself on land by means of them; it likewise
makes use of them to swim, while it keeps its tail on the
surface contiguous to the air, and hangs downward with the
rest of the body in the water: in this situation no motion is perceived
in it, but what arises from its legs, which it moves in a
most elegant manner. It is reasonable to conclude from what
has been said, that the principal part of the creature&#8217;s strength
lies in these legs; nor will it be difficult for those who are acquainted
with the nature of the ancient hieroglyphics, which are
now opening so clearly, to fix the rank of this insect in animated
life, and point out those orders of being, and the moral
state through which it receives its form and habits of life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page252">[252]</span></p>

<p>The snout is black and hard, the back part is quite solid, and
somewhat of a globular form, whereas the front f, is sharp and
hollow; on the back part three membranaceous divisions may be
observed, by means of which, and the muscles contained in the
snout, the insect can at pleasure expand or contract it.</p>

<p>The tail is constructed and planned with great skill and wisdom.
The extreme verge or border, is surrounded by thirty hairs, and
the sides adorned with others that are smaller; here and there the
large hairs branch out into smaller ones, which may be reckoned
as single hairs. These hairs are all rooted in the outer skin,
which in this place is covered with rough grains, as may be seen
by cutting it off, and holding it up, when dry, against the light,
upon a thin plate of glass. By the same mode you will find, that
at the extremities of the hairs there are also grains like those of
the skin; in the middle of the tail there is a small opening, within
it are minute holes, by which the insect inhales and expels the
air it breathes. The hairs are very seldom disposed in so regular
a manner as they are represented in Fig. 3. <a href="#Plate11">Plate XI.</a> except
when the insect floats with the body in the water, and the tail
with its hairs a little lower than the surface, for they are then
displayed exactly as delineated in the plate. The least motion
downward of the tail produces a concavity in the water, and it
then assumes the figure of a wine-glass, wide at the top, narrow
at the bottom. The tail serves the larva both for the purposes of
swimming and breathing, and it receives through the tail that
which is the universal principle of life and motion in animals.
By means of the hairs it can stop itself at pleasure when swimming,
or remain suspended quietly in the water for any length of
time. The motion of the insect in swimming is very beautiful,
especially when it advances with its whole body floating on the
surface of the water; after filling itself with air by the tail. To
set out, it first bends the body to the right or left, and then contracts<span class="pagenum" id="Page253">[253]</span>
it in the form of the letter S, and again stretches it out in a
strait line: by thus alternately contracting and then extending
the body, it moves along on the surface of the water. It is of a
very quiet disposition, and not to be disturbed by handling.</p>

<p>These larv&aelig; are generally to be found in shallow standing
waters, about the beginning of June, sooner or later, as the summer
is more or less favourable; in some seasons they are to be
found in great numbers, while in others, it is no easy matter to
meet with them. They love to crawl on the plants and grass
which grow in the water, and are often to be met with in ditches,
floating on the surface of the water by means of their tail, the
head and thorax at the same time hanging down; and in this situation
they will turn over the clay and dirt with their snout and
feet in search of food, which is generally a viscous matter that is
common in small ponds and about the sides of ditches. This
worm is very harmless, contrary to the opinion one might form
at first sight, from the surprizing vibratory motion of the legs,
which resembles the brandishing of an envenomed tongue or sting.
They are most easily killed for dissection in spirit of turpentine.</p>

<p>After a certain period they pass into the pupa form; when
they are about to change, they betake themselves to the herbs
that float on the surface of the water, and creep gently thereon,
till at length they lie partly on the dry surface, and partly on the
water; when in the larva or pupa state, they can live in water,
but can by no means inhabit there when changed into flies: indeed,
man also, whilst in the uterus, lives in water, which he cannot
do afterwards. When these worms have found a proper situation,
they by degrees contract themselves, and in a manner scarce
perceptible lose all power of motion. The inward parts of the
worm&#8217;s tail now separate from the outmost skin, and become
greatly contracted; this probably gives the insect considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page254">[254]</span>
pain: by this contraction, an empty space is left in the exterior
skin, into which the air soon penetrates.</p>

<p>Thus this insect passes into the pupa state under its own skin,
entirely different from that of the caterpillar, which casts off the
exterior skin at this time; this change may often be observed to
take place in the space of ten or twelve hours, but in what
manner it is performed we are ignorant, as it is effected in a
hidden unknown way, inwardly within the skin, which conceals
it from our view.</p>

<p>Whilst the larva is changing under the skin, the body, head,
and tail, separate insensibly from their outward vesture. The
legs at this time, and their cartilaginous bones, are, on account of
the parts which are withdrawn from them, left empty; the worm
loses also now the former skull, the beak, together with the
horny bones belonging thereto, which remain in the skin of
the exuvia. It is worthy of notice, that the optic nerves separate
also from the eyes, and no more perform their office.
The muscles of the rings in like manner, and a great part of the
pulmonary points of respiration, are separated from the external
skin. Thus the whole body contracts itself by degrees into a
small compact mass. At this time the gullet and the pulmonary
tubes cast a coat within the skin. To make this evident, it is
necessary to open the abdomen, when the pupa, its parts, together
with the cast off pulmonary pipes, may be clearly seen.</p>

<p>An exact account of all the changes of the interior parts is to be
found in Swammerdam&#8217;s Book of Nature. These changes are
best examined by taking the pupa out of the skin, or outside
case, when it begins to harden; for as it has not then quite attained
the pupa form, and the members are somewhat different
from what they will be when in that state, it is more easy to observe<span class="pagenum" id="Page255">[255]</span>
their respective situation, than when the pupa is some days
older, and has lost the greatest part of the superfluous humours.
The pupa is inclosed in a double garment; the interior one is a
thin membrane, which invests it very closely; the other, or exterior
one, is formed of the outermost hard skin of the larva, within
which it performs its changes in an invisible manner: it is this
skin which gives it the appearance of the larva while in the pupa
state.</p>

<p>When the time approaches that the hidden insect, now in the
pupa form within its old covering, is to attain the imago, fly, or
perfect state, which generally happens in about eleven days after
the preceding change, the superfluous humours are evaporated by
insensible perspiration. The little pupa is contracted into the
fifth ring of the skin, and the four last rings of the abdomen are
filled with air, through the aperture in the respiratory orifice of
the tail. This may be seen by exposing the pupa for a short
space to the rays of the sun, and then putting its tail in water,
when you will find it breathe stronger than it did before, and, by
expressing an air bubble out of its tail, and then sucking it in
again, will manifestly perform the action of inspiration and expiration.
The anterior part of the pupa is drawn back from the
skin, and having partly deserted it, with the beak, head, and first
ring of the breast, the little creature lies still, until its exhaling
members have acquired strength to burst the two membranes
which surround it.</p>

<p>If the exterior case be opened near this period, a wonderful
variety of colour may be perceived through the thin skin which
invests the pupa. The colours of many of the different parts are
now changed; some parts from aqueous become membranaceous,
some fleshy, and others crustaceous. The whole body becomes
insensibly shaggy, the feet and claws begin to move: the variations<span class="pagenum" id="Page256">[256]</span>
may be accurately observed by opening a pupa every day
until the time of change. For this purpose they should be laid
on white paper in an earthen dish; they should also be made
somewhat moist, and be kept under a glass: the paper serves the
pupa to fix its claw to, when they come forth in the form of a fly.
A little water should be poured into the dish, to keep the pupa
from drying and suffocation.</p>

<p>When the fly begins to appear, the exterior skin is seen to
move about the third and fourth anterior ring; the insect then
uses all its efforts to promote its escape, and to quit the interior
and exterior skin at one and the same time. The exterior skin is
divided into four parts; the insect immediately afterwards breaks
open its inner coat, and casting it off, escapes from the prison in
which it was entombed, in the form of a beautiful fly. It is to
be observed here, that there is nothing accidental in the breaking
of the outermost skin, being perfectly conformable to the rule
ordained, always happening in the same manner in all these
changes: the skin also is, in those places where it is broke open,
so constructed by the Author of nature, as if joined together by
sutures. Having now acquired its perfect state, the little creature
which lived before in water and mud, enters into a new scene
of life, visits the fields and meadows, is transported through the
air on its elegant wings, and sports in the wide expanse with unrestrained
jollity and freedom.</p>

<p>The larva a queue de rat,<a href="#Footnote76" id="FNanchor76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> musca pendula, Lin. is also transformed
under the skin, which hardens, and forms a case or general
covering to the pupa: two horns are pushed out, while it
is in this state, from the interior parts; they serve the purpose of
respiration: this larva will be more particularly described in a
subsequent part of this chapter.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote76"><a href="#FNanchor76" class="label">[76]</a> Reaum. 8vo. edit. tom. 4, pt. 2, 11 mem. p. 199, plate 30 and 31.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page257">[257]</span></p>

<p>According to Reaumur, the insects in this class, that is, those
that pass into the pupa state under the skin of the larva, go
through a change more than the caterpillar, a transformation
taking place while under their skin, before they assume the pupa
form.</p>

<p>The aquatic larva of the musca cham&aelig;leon retains its form to
the last; but there are many insects that are transformed under
their skin, which forms a cone or case for the pupa. In these the
larva loses first its length; the body becoming shorter, assumes
the figure of an egg; and the skin forms a hard and crustaceous
case or solid lodging for the embryo insect.</p>

<h3>OF THE LIBELLULA OR DRAGON FLY.</h3>

<p>In the libellula we have an instance of those insects which are
termed in the pupa state, semicompleta, that is, such as proceed
from the egg in the figure which they preserve till the time arrives
for assuming their wings; and who walk, act, and eat as
well before that period as afterwards.</p>

<p>Of all the flies which adorn or diversify the face of nature,
there are few, if any, more beautiful than the libellul&aelig;: they are
almost of all colours, green, blue, crimson, scarlet, and white;
some unite a variety of the most vivid teints, and exhibit in one
animal more different shades than are to be found in the rainbow.
It is not to colour alone that their beauty is confined, it is
heightened by the brilliancy of their eyes, and the delicate texture
and wide expansion of their wings. The larva of the libellula
is an inhabitant of the water, the fly itself is generally found
hovering on the borders thereof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page258">[258]</span></p>

<p>These insects are produced from an egg, which is deposited in
the water by the parent; the egg sinks to the bottom, and remains
there till the young insect finds strength to break the shell.
The larva is hexapode, and is not quite so long as the fly; on the
trunk are four prominences or little bunches, which become more
apparent, in proportion as the larva increases in size and changes
its skin. These bunches contain the rudiments of the wings,
which adorn the insect when in its perfect state.</p>

<p>The head of the larva is exceedingly singular, the whole fore
part of it being covered with a mask, which fits it more exactly
than the common mask does the human face, having proper
cavities within to suit the different prominences of the face; it
is of a triangular form, growing smaller towards the bottom; at
this part there is a knuckle which fits a cavity near the neck, on
this it turns as on a pivot. The upper part of this mask is divided
into two pieces or shutters, which the insect can open or
close at pleasure; it can also let down the whole mask whenever
it pleases. The edges of the shutters are jagged like a saw. It
makes use of the mask to seize and hold its prey. There is a
considerable difference in the shape of these masks in different
species of the libellula, some having two claws near the top of it,
which they can thrust out or draw in, as most convenient; these
render it a very formidable instrument to the insects on which
they feed.</p>

<p>These animals generally live and feed at the bottom of the
water, swimming only occasionally: their manner of swimming,
or rather moving in the water, is curious, being by sudden jerks
given at intervals; but this motion is not occasioned by their
legs, which at this time are kept immoveable and close to the
body; it is by forcing out a stream of water from the tail that
the body is carried forward; this may be easily perceived, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page259">[259]</span>
placing them in a flat vessel, in which there is only just water
enough to cover the bottom. Here the action of the water
squirted from their tail will be very visible; it will occasion a
small current, and give a sensible motion to any light bodies that
are lying on the surface thereof. This action can only be effected
at intervals, because after each expulsion the insect is obliged to
inhale a fresh supply of water. The larva will sometimes turn
its tail above the surface of the water, and eject a small stream
from it as from a little fountain, and that with considerable force.</p>

<p>The pupa differs but very little from the larva, the bunches
containing the wings grow large, and begin to appear like four
short thick wings. It is full as lively as the larva, seeking and
enjoying its food in the same manner: when it is arrived at its
full growth, and is nearly ready to go through its last change, it
approaches the edge of the water, or comes entirely out of it,
fixing itself firmly to some piece of wood or other substance, by
its acute claws. It remains for some time immoveable; the skin
then opens down the back, and on the head; through this opening
is exhibited the real head and eyes, and at length the legs;
it then creeps gradually forward, drawing its wings, and then the
body out of the skin. The wings, which are moist and folded,
now expand themselves to their real size; the body is also extended
till it has gained its proper dimensions, which extension
is accomplished by the propelling force of the circulating fluids.
When the wings and limbs are dry, it enters on a more noble
state of life: in this new scene it enjoys itself to the fullest extent,
feasts on the living fragrance issuing from innumerable
openings, sports and revels in delight, and, having laid the foundation
for its future progeny, sinks into an easy dissolution.</p>

<p>The dragon fly is of a ferocious and warlike disposition, hovering
in the air like a bird of prey, in order to feed on and destroy<span class="pagenum" id="Page260">[260]</span>
every species of fly; its appetite is gross and voracious, not confining
itself to small flies only, but the large flesh-fly, moths, and
butterflies, are equally subjected to its tyranny. It frequents
marshy grounds, where insects mostly abound.</p>

<p>The female of the <span class="smcapall">CYNIPS</span> or <span class="smcapall">GALL INSECT</span>, which has no
wings, passes through no transformation; while the male, which
has four wings, passes through the pupa state before it becomes
a fly. The only change, though a considerable one, which takes
place in the female gall insect, is this, that after a certain time
it fixes itself to the branch of a tree, without being able to detach
itself; it afterwards increases much in size, and becomes
like a true gall; the female, by remaining thus fixed for the
greater part of her life, to the place where she was first seen, has
very little the appearance of an animal; it is in this period of
their life that they grow most and produce their young, while
they appear a portion of the branch they adhere to; and what is
more singular, the larger they grow, the less they appear like
animals, and whilst they are employed in laying thousands of
eggs, seem to be nothing but mere galls. The genera of gall insects
are very extensive; they are to be found on almost every
shrub and tree.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcapall">APHIDES</span> or <span class="smcapall">PLANT LICE</span>, to arrive at their respective
state, pass through that of the semicomplete pupa, and their
wings do not appear till they have quitted their pupa state; but as
in all the families of the pucerons there are many which never
become winged, we must not forget to observe, that these undergo
no transformation, remaining always the same, without
changing their figure, though they increase in size and change
their skin. It is remarkable, that amongst insects of the same
kind, some individuals should be transformed, while others are<span class="pagenum" id="Page261">[261]</span>
not at all changed. These insects will be considered more fully
in another part of this chapter.</p>

<p>Reaumur<a href="#Footnote77" id="FNanchor77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> has
shewn that the <span class="smcapall">SPIDER FLY</span>, hyppobosca
equina, Lin. lays so large an egg, that the fly which proceeds
from it is as big as the mother, though the egg does not increase
the least in size from the time it is first laid. The insect proceeds
also from the egg in the imago or fly state; it is probably transformed
in the egg, for Reaumur has found it in the pupa state
therein, and having boiled some of their eggs which had been
laid for some days, he found the insect in the form of an oval
ball, similar to that in which the pupa of flies with two wings
are generally found. De Geer is of opinion that the egg itself is
a true larva, which, when it is born, has only to disengage its
limbs, &amp;c. from the shell which covers it; and he thinks this the
more probable, because there is no embryo seen in this egg, but it
is entirely filled with the insect; he has also perceived a contracting
and dilating motion in the egg, while it was in the belly of
the mother, and immediately after it was laid; circumstances
which do not agree with a simple egg.</p>

<p>As M. Bonnet<a href="#Footnote78" id="FNanchor78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> has attempted to give a theory of these various
changes, the following extract from it will, I hope, prove
agreeable to the reader; it will at least tend to render his ideas of
this wonderful subject clearer, and will probably open to his
mind many new sources of contemplation.</p>

<p id="Footnote78"><a href="#FNanchor78" class="label">[78]</a> Bonnet Considerations

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>An insect that must cast off its exuvia, or moult five times before
it attains the pupa state, may be considered as composed of
five organized bodies, inclosed within each other, and nourished<span class="pagenum" id="Page262">[262]</span>
by common viscera, placed in the center: what the bud of the
tree is to the invisible buds it contains, such is the exterior part of
the caterpillar to the interior bodies it conceals in its bosom.
Four of these bodies have the same essential structure, namely,
that which is peculiar to the insect in its larva or caterpillar state:
the fifth body is that of the pupa. The respective state of these
bodies is in proportion to their distance from the center of the
animal; those that are farthest off have most consistence, or unfold
themselves soonest. When the exterior body has attained
its full growth, that interior one which is next in order is considerably
unfolded; it is then lodged in too narrow a compass,
therefore it stretches on all sides the sheath which covers it; the
vessels which nourish the external covering, are broken by this
violent distension, and ceasing to act, the skin wrinkles and dries
up; at length it opens, and the insect is cloathed with a new skin,
and new organs. The insect generally fasts for a day or two
preceding each change; this is probably occasioned by the violent
state in which it then is, or it may be necessary to prevent
obstructions, &amp;c. let this be as it may, the insect is always very
weak after it has changed its skin, the parts being as yet affected
by the exertions they have gone through. The scaly parts, as the
head and legs, are almost entirely membranaceous, and imbrued
with a fluid that insinuates itself between the two skins, and thus
facilitates their separation; this moisture evaporates by degrees,
all the parts acquire a consistence, and the insect is then in a
condition to act.</p>

<p>The first use that some caterpillars which live on leaves make
of their new form, is to devour greedily their exuvia: sometimes
they do not wait till their jaws have acquired their full strength;
some have been seen to gnaw the shell from which they proceeded,
and even the eggs of such caterpillars as have not been
hatched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page263">[263]</span></p>

<p>When we have once formed the idea that all the exterior parts
are inlaid, or included one within the other, the production of
new organs does not appear so embarrassing, being nothing more
than a simple developement; but it is more difficult to form any
conception of the changes that happen in the viscera before and
after the transformation, the various modifications they undergo
eluding our researches. We have already observed, that a little
before the change the caterpillar rejects the membrane that lines
the intestinal bag: this bowel has hitherto digested only gross
food, whereas it must hereafter digest that which is very delicate:
a fluid that circulates in the caterpillar from the hind part towards
the head, circulates a contrary way after transformation. Now
if this inversion is as real as observation seems to indicate, how
amazing the change the interior parts of the animal must have
undergone? When the caterpillar moults, small clusters of the
tracheal vessels are cast off with the exuvia, and new ones are
substituted in their room; but how is this effected, and how are
the lungs replaced by other lungs? The more we endeavour to
investigate this subject, the more we find it is enveloped in
darkness.</p>

<p>Whilst the powers of life are employed conformable to the
laws of Divine Providence, to change the viscera, and give them
a new form, they are also unfolding divers other organs, which
were useless to the insect while in the larva state, but which are
necessary to that which succeeds. That these interior operations
of life may be carried on with greater energy, the animal is
thrown into a kind of sleep; during this period, the corpus
crassum is distributed into all the parts, in order to bring them to
perfection, while the evaporation of the superfluous humours
makes way for the elements of the fibres to approach each other,
and unite more closely. The little wounds in the inside, which
have been occasioned by the rupture of the vessels, are gradually<span class="pagenum" id="Page264">[264]</span>
consolidated; those parts which had been violently exercised,
recover their tone, and the circulating fluids insensibly find their
new channel. Lastly, many vessels are effaced, and turned into
a liquid sediment, which is rejected by the perfect insect.</p>

<p>When these various changes are considered, we are surprized
at the singularity of the means the <span class="smcap">Author of nature</span> has made
choice of, in order to bring the different species of animals to
perfection; and are apt to ask, why the caterpillar was not born
a moth? why it passes through the larva and pupa state? why
all insects that are transformed do not undergo the same change?
These, and a variety of questions that may be started concerning
the constituent substances of those existences which appear
before us, derive their solution from the general system which is
unknown to us. If all were to arrive at perfection at once, the
chain would be broken, the creature unhappy, and man most
of all. Let us also consider what riches we should have
been deprived of, if the silk-worm had been born in its perfect
state.</p>

<p>Amongst insects, some are produced in the state in which they
will remain during their whole lives; others come forth inclosed
in an egg, and are hatched from this into a form that admits of
no variation; many come into the world under a form which
differs but little from that which they have when arrived at an
age of maturity; some again assume various forms, more or less
remote from that which constitutes their perfect state; lastly,
some go through part of these transformations in the body of the
parent, and are born of an equal size with them. By these various
changes, a single individual unites within itself two or
three different species, and becomes successively the inhabitant
of two or three worlds: and how great is the diversity of its
operation in these various abodes!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page265">[265]</span></p>

<p>Since it has been shewn that the larva or caterpillar is really
the moth, crawling, eating, and spinning, under the form of the
worm, and that the pupa is only the moth swathed up, it is clear
that they are not three beings, but that the same individual feels,
tastes, sees, and acts by different organs, at different periods of its
life, having sensations and wants at one time, which it has not
at another; these always bearing a relation to the organs which
excite them.</p>

<h3>OF THE RESPIRATION OF INSECTS.</h3>

<p>As respiration is one of the most important actions in the life
of every animal, great pains have been taken by many naturalists
to investigate the nature of this action in insects; to prove its
existence, and explain in what manner it is carried on. Malpighi,
Swammerdam, Reaumur, and Lyonet have discovered in the caterpillar
two air-vessels placed the whole length of the insect,
these they have called the trache&aelig;; they have also shewn that
an infinite number of ramifications proceed from these, and are
dispersed through the whole body; that the tracheal vessels communicate
with particular openings on the skin of the caterpillar,
termed spiracula; there are nine of these on each side of the body.
These vessels seem calculated for the reception of air; they contain
no fluids, are of a cartilaginous nature, and when cut preserve
their figure, and exhibit a well-terminated opening. Notwithstanding
this discovery, respiration has not been proved to
exist in many species of insects, and the mechanism thereof is
very obscure in all; nor is the absence of it more surprising in
the caterpillar or embryo state of insects, than in that of other
animals, where we find that respiration is by no means necessary
to existence previous to their birth, though indispensably so afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page266">[266]</span></p>

<p>Reaumur thought that the air entered by the spiracula into the
trachea, but was not expelled by the same orifice, and consequently
that the respiration of insects was carried on in a manner totally
different from that of other animals; that the air was expired
through a number of small holes or pores which are to be found
in the skin of the caterpillar, after having been conducted to
them through the extremities of the finer ramifications of the tracheal
vessels; whereas Bonnet, in consequence of a great variety
of experiments, supposed that the inspiration and expiration of
the air was through the spiracula, and that there was no expiration
of air through the pores of the skin. These experiments
were made either by plunging the caterpillars into water, or
anointing them with fat and greasy substances, some all over,
others only partially. The number of small bubbles which are
observed to cover the surface of their bodies, when they are immerged
in water, does not arise from the air which is included
within, and then proceeding from them, but they are formed by
the air which is lodged near the surface of their bodies, in the
same manner that it is about all other substances. To render the
experiments more accurate, and prevent the air from adhering to
the skin, before he plunged the caterpillars in water he always
brushed them over with an hair pencil; after this, very few air
bubbles were found on their bodies when immerged in water.
Caterpillars will remain a considerable time under water, without
destroying the principle of life; and they also recover, in general,
soon after they are taken out. To know whether a few only of
the spiracula might not be sufficient for the purposes of respiration,
he plunged some partially in water, so that only two or
more spiracula remained in the open air: in these cases the caterpillar
did not become torpid as it did when they were all immerged
in water. One caterpillar, upon which Bonnet made his
experiments, lived eight days suspended in water, with only two<span class="pagenum" id="Page267">[267]</span>
of its anterior spiracula in the air; during this time he observed,
that when the insect moved itself, little streams of bubbles issued
from the anterior spiracula on the left side; from this, and many
other experiments, it appeared to him, that amongst all the
eighteen spiracula, the two anterior and the two posterior are of
the greatest use in respiration.<a href="#Footnote79" id="FNanchor79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Sometimes when the apertures
of these have been stopped with oil, the caterpillar has fallen
into convulsions. If the posterior part had been oiled, that part
became paralytic. Notwithstanding these experiments, and
many more which have been made, the subject is far from being
decided, and many still doubt whether there is any respiration in
insects similar to ours, at least at certain periods of their life.
This opinion seems to be further confirmed by the experiments
of M. Lyonet. He confined several large musk beetles under a
glass for more than half an hour, exposed to the fumes of burning
sulphur; and, though during their continuance there the vapour
was so thick that he could not see them, yet on their being
liberated, they did not seem at all effected thereby.<a href="#Footnote80" id="FNanchor80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Supposing respiration to be absolutely necessary to the existence
of the pup&aelig; of different insects, when we reflect on the
great solidity of their cases or cones, it is not easy to conceive
how they can live several months under the earth, in spaces so
confined, and almost impervious to the air: and indeed if they
did respire, the same situation seems to preclude a continuance of
the operation, as the air would soon be corrupted, and unfit for
the offices of life. As the trache&aelig; are divided and subdivided to
a prodigious degree of minuteness, it has been conjectured by<span class="pagenum" id="Page268">[268]</span>
some writers, that they may act as so many sieves, which, by separations
properly contrived, filtrate the air, and so furnish it to
the body of different degrees of purity and subtilty, agreeable to
the purposes and nature of the various parts. The experiments
that have been made with the air-pump are by no means conclusive;
the injury which the insect sustains when the atmospheric
pressure is taken from the body, does not prove that it
inspired and expired the air that we have removed; it only shews
that an incumbent pressure is necessary to their comfortable existence,
as it prevents the fluids from disengaging themselves in
an aerial form, and as it counterbalances and re-acts on the principle
of life, and, by keeping the action thereof in proper tone and
order, confines and regulates its energies.</p>

<p>Though it is difficult to ascertain whether some insects respire,
at least at certain periods of their existence, yet there are others
to whom the inspiration and expiration of air seems absolutely
necessary: there are many aquatic insects which are obliged to
keep their tails suspended on the surface of the water for this
purpose. To prove this, keep the tail under water, and you will
perceive the insect to be agitated and uneasy, and to seek for
some opening to expose this part to the air; if it find none, it
soon goes to the bottom and dies. Some aquatic beetles resist
the trial for a considerable time, while their larv&aelig; can only support
it for a few minutes. There is a circumstance which renders
all experiments on this subject with insects doubtful and difficult,
namely, the vast tenaciousness of the life principle in the lower
orders of animated nature, and its dissemination through their
whole frame.</p>

<p>Musschenbroeck inclosed the pupa of a moth in a glass tube,
very little larger than the moth itself, and of the following figure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page269">[269]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illo269.jpg" alt="Glass tube" width="500" height="159" />
</div>

<p>The end A of the tube was drawn out in a capillary form, the
other end was covered with a piece of wet bladder to exclude the
air; the capillary end B was then plunged in water, which rose
to D. He placed the capillary part of the tube before a microscope,
on a small micrometer, in order to observe any motion or
change in the situation of the water; as it is evident the expiration
or inspiration of air by the insect would make it rise or fall
alternately. In the first experiment he observed a small degree of
motion at distant intervals, not above two or three times in an
hour; in a second experiment on another subject, he could observe
no motion at all. He then placed some pup&aelig; under the
receiver of an air-pump, in water which he had previously purged
of its air; on exhausting the air from the receiver, he observed
one bubble to arise in a part near the tail, and a few near the
wings. The pup&aelig; did not swell under the operation; on the
contrary, on letting in the air, it was found to be diminished in a
small degree, but in less than a quarter of an hour it recovered
its former figure. M. Martinet published at Leyden, in 1753, a
dissertation, in which, it is said, he has clearly proved by a number
of experiments that the pup&aelig; of caterpillars and some other
insects do not respire.</p>

<h3>OF RESPIRATION IN THE LARVA OF THE MUSCA PENDULA.</h3>

<p>Among the insects in which respiration seems to be most
clearly proved, are the larv&aelig; of the musca pendula, Lin. These,
while in the worm state, live under water in the mud, to which
they affix themselves; the respiration of fresh air in this situation<span class="pagenum" id="Page270">[270]</span>
is necessary to their existence; for this purpose they are furnished
with a tail, which often appears of an excessive length comparatively
with the body, as this is seldom more than three quarters of
an inch in length, while the tail is frequently more than four
inches; it is composed of two tubes, which run one into the other,
something similar to the tubes of a refracting telescope. Besides
this, the materials of which the tubes are composed are capable
of a great degree of extension. When the tail is at its full length,
it is exceeding small, not being larger near the extremity than a
horse-hair; there is a little knob at the end, which is furnished
with small hairs, to extend on the water, in some measure resembling
those at the tail of the musca cham&aelig;leon.</p>

<p>In the body of the larva are two large tracheal vessels; these
air-vessels extend from the head to the tail, terminate in the respiring
tubes, and receive the air from them. The larva quits the
water when the time of its transformation approaches, and enters
into the earth, where the skin hardens and forms a case in which
the pupa is formed; soon after the change, four tubes or horns are
seen projecting from the case: these Reaumur supposes to be
organs for communicating air to the interior parts of the insect;
they are connected with little bladders which are found filled
with air, and by which it is conveyed to the spiracula of the
pupa. The larv&aelig; of gnats, and other small aquatic insects of the
same kind, are furnished with small tubes, that play on the surface
of the water, and convey the air from thence to the insect.
Many other singularities are to be found amongst the aquatic
larv&aelig;.</p>

<h3>OF THE GENERATION OF INSECTS.</h3>

<p>One of the greatest mysteries in nature is generation, or that
power by which the various species of animals, &amp;c. are propagated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page271">[271]</span>
enabling one single individual to give birth to thousands,
or even millions of individuals like itself; all formed agreeable to
proportions which are only known to that <span class="smcapall">ADORABLE WISDOM</span>
which has established them. We shall never be able to form any
adequate conception of this power, till we are acquainted with
the principles of life, and can trace their various gradations in
different orders of beings. Many ancient philosophers, from a
misconception and perversion of the sentiments of the more ancient
sages, imagined that insects were produced from corrupt
and putrefied substances; that organized bodies, animated with
life, and framed in a most wonderful manner, owed their origin
to mere chance! Not so the most ancient sages; they taught that
every degree of life must proceed from the fountain and source of
all life, and that therefore, when manifested, it must be replete
with infinite wonders; but then they also shewed, that if in its
descent through the higher orders of being it was perverted, it
would be manifested in loathsome forms, and with filthy propensities;
and that according to the degree of reception of the Divine
Goodness and Truth, or the perversion thereof, new forms of life
would be occasionally manifested. The gloom of night still
wraps this subject in obscurity; will the dawn of day ere long
gild the horizon of the scientific world? or is the time of its
breaking forth yet far from us? Be this as it may, insects will be
found to conform to that general law of order which runs through
the whole of animated nature, namely, that the conjunction of
the male and female is necessary for the production of their offspring.
Where we cannot ascertain causes, we must be content
with facts.</p>

<p>Though insects are, like larger animals, distinguished into male
and female, yet in some classes there is a kind of mules, partaking
of neither sex, though themselves originating from the conjunction
of both: many other particularities relative to the sexes can<span class="pagenum" id="Page272">[272]</span>
only be touched upon here. In many insects the male and female
are with difficulty distinguished, and in some they differ so widely,
that an unskilful person might easily take the male and female of
the same insect for different species; as for instance, in the phal&aelig;na
humuli, piniaria, russula. The dissimilarity is still greater
in those insects in which the male has wings and the female none,
as in the coccus lampyris, phal&aelig;na antiqua, &amp;c. In general the
male is smaller than the female. The antenn&aelig; of the male are,
for the most part, larger than those of the female. In some
moths, and other insects which are furnished with feathered antenn&aelig;,
the feathers of the male fly are large and beautiful, while
those of the female are small, and hardly perceptible. Some
male beetles are furnished with a horn, which is wanting in the
female.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pleraque insectorum genitalia sua intra anum habent abscondita,
et penes solitarios, sed nonnulla penem habent bifidum:
cancri autem et aranei geminos, quemadmodum nonnulla amphibia,
et quod mirandum in loco alieno, ut cancer, sub basi caud&aelig;.
Araneus mas palpos habet clavatos, qui penes sunt, juxta os utrinque
unicum, qu&aelig; clav&aelig; sexum nec speciem distinguunt; et f&#339;mina
vulvas suas habet in abdomine juxta pectus; heic vero si
unquam vere dixeris: res plena timoris amor, si enim procus inauspicato
accesserit, f&#339;mina ipsum devorat, quod etiam fit, si non
statim se retraxerit. Libellula f&#339;mina genitale suum sub apice
gerit caud&aelig;, et mas sub pectore, adeo ut cum mas collum f&#339;mina
forcipe caud&aelig; arripit, illa caudam suam pectori ejus adplicet, sicque
peculiari ratione connex&aelig; volitent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Insects are either oviparous or viviparous; or, in other words,
the species is perpetuated either by their laying of eggs, or bringing
forth their young alive. The former is the more general
case; there are but few instances of the latter. Those insects<span class="pagenum" id="Page273">[273]</span>
which pass through the different transformations already described,
cannot propagate till they arrive at their imago or perfect
state; and we believe there is seldom any conjunction of the
sexes in other classes till they have moulted, or put off their last
skin, the cancri and monoculi excepted.</p>

<p>To form a just idea of the ovaries of insects, I could wish
the reader to consult the description that Swammerdam has given
of that of the queen bee, and to take a view of the elegant
figure that accompanies it, a figure that speaks to the eyes, and
by them to the imagination. Malpighi has given a description
of the ovaries of the silk-worm moth.</p>

<p>Reaumur mentions six or seven species of two-winged flies
that are viviparous, bringing forth worms, which are afterwards
transformed into flies. The womb of one of these is singularly
curious; it is formed of a band rolled up in a spiral form, and
about two inches and an half in length; so that it is seven or eight
times longer than the body of the fly, and composed of worms
placed one on the side of the other with wonderful art: they are
many thousands in number.<a href="#Footnote81" id="FNanchor81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>These are a species of insects that have opened new views of
the &#339;conomy of animated beings; they belong to the hemiptera
class. The rostrum is inflected, the antenn&aelig; are longer than the
thorax; some have four erect wings, others are entirety without
them. Towards the end of the abdomen there are two tubes
ejecting that most delicate juice called honey-dew. Various
names have been applied to them, the proper one is aphis, that by<span class="pagenum" id="Page274">[274]</span>
which they are most generally known, is puceron; they are also
frequently called vine-fretters or plant-lice: many among the genera
are both oviparous and viviparous, bringing forth their young
alive in summer, but in autumn depositing their eggs upon the
branches and bark of trees. The different aphides are very curious
objects for the microscope: they are a very numerous genus,
Linn&aelig;us has enumerated thirty-three different species, whose trivial
names are taken from the plant which they inhabit, though
it is probable the number is much larger, as the same plant is
often found to support two or three different sorts of them.
Their habits are very singular: an aphis or puceron, brought up
in the most perfect solitude from the very moment of its birth,
in a few days will be found in the midst of a numerous family;
repeat the experiment on one of the individuals of this family,
and you will find this second generation will multiply like its
parent; and this you may pursue through many generations.</p>

<p>M. Bonnet had repeated experiments of this kind, as far as the
sixth generation, which all uniformly presented the observer with
fruitful virgins, when he was engaged in a series of new and
tedious experiments, from a suspicion imparted by M. Trembley
in a letter to him, who thus expresses himself: &#8220;I have formed
the design of rearing several generations of solitary pucerons, in
order to see if they would all equally bring forth young. In
cases so remote from usual circumstances, it is allowed to try all
sorts of means; and I argued with myself, Who knows but that
one copulation might serve for several generations?&#8221; This &#8220;<span class="smcapall">WHO
KNOWS</span>&#8221; persuaded M. Bonnet that he had not sufficiently pursued
his investigations. He therefore now reared to the tenth
generation his solitary aphides, having the patience to keep an
exact account of the days and hours of the birth of each generation.
The result of this pursuit was, his discovering both males
and females among them, whose amours were not in the least<span class="pagenum" id="Page275">[275]</span>
equivocal; the males are produced only in the tenth generation,
and are but few in number; these soon arriving at their full
growth, copulate with the females, and the virtue of this copulation
serves for ten successive generations; all these generations,
except the first from fecundated eggs, are produced viviparous,
and all the individuals are females, except those of the last generation,
among whom some males appear, to lay the foundation of
a fresh series.</p>

<p>In order to give a further insight into the nature of these insects,
I shall insert an extract of a description of their different generations,
by Dr. Richardson, as published in the Philosophical Transactions
for the year 1771.</p>

<p>The great variety of species which occur in the insects now
under consideration, may make an inquiry into their particular
natures seem not a little perplexing, but by reducing them under
their proper genera, the difficulty is considerably diminished. We
may reasonably suppose all the insects, comprehended under any
distinct genus, to partake of one general nature; and, by diligently
examining any particular species, may thence gain some
insight into the nature of all the rest. With this view Dr. Richardson
chose out of the various sorts of aphides the largest of
those found on the rose-tree, not only as its size makes it the
more conspicuous, but as there are few others of so long a duration.
This sort appears early in the spring, and continues late in
the autumn; while several are limited to a much shorter term, in
conformity to the different trees and plants from whence they
draw their nourishment.</p>

<p>If at the beginning of February the weather happen to be so
warm, as to make the buds of the rose-tree swell and appear
green, small aphides are frequently to be found on them, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page276">[276]</span>
not larger than the young ones in summer, when first produced.
It will be found, that those aphides which appear only in spring,
proceed from small black oval eggs, which were deposited on the
last year&#8217;s shoots; though when it happens that the insects make
too early an appearance, the greater part suffers from the sharp
weather that usually succeeds; by which means the rose-trees are
some years in a manner freed from them. The same kind of animal
is then at one time of the year viviparous, and at another,
oviparous. Those aphides which withstand the severity of the
weather seldom come to their full growth before the month of
April, at which time they usually begin to breed, after twice
casting off their exuvia, or outward covering. It appears that
they are all females, which produce each of them a numerous
progeny, and that without having intercourse with any male insect;
they are viviparous, and what is equally singular, the
young ones all come into the world backwards. When they first
come from the parent, they are enveloped by a thin membrane,
having in this situation the appearance of an oval egg; these
egg-like appearances adhere by one extremity to the mother,
while the young ones contained in them extend the other, by
that means gradually drawing the ruptured membrane over the
head and body to the hind feet. During this operation, and for
some time after, the fore part of the head adheres, by means of
something glutinous, to the vent of the parent. Being thus suspended
in the air, it soon frees itself from the membrane in
which it was confined; and after its limbs are a little strengthened,
is set down on some tender shoots, and left to provide for
itself.</p>

<p>In the spring months there appear on the rose-trees but two
generations of aphides, including those which proceed immediately
from the last year&#8217;s eggs; the warmth of the summer adds
so much to their fertility, that no less than five generations succeed<span class="pagenum" id="Page277">[277]</span>
one another in the interval. One is produced in May, which
casts off its covering; while the months of June and July each
supply two more, which cast off their coverings three or four
times, according to the different warmth of the season. This frequent
change of their outward coat is the more extraordinary, because
it is repeated more often when the insects come the soonest
to their growth, which sometimes happens in ten days, where
warmth and plenty of nourishment conspired.</p>

<p>Early in the month of June, some of the third generation, which
were produced about the middle of May, after casting off their
last covering, discover four erect wings, much longer than their
bodies; and the same is observable in all the succeeding generations
which are produced during the summer months, but still
without any diversity of sex; for some time before the aphides
come to their full growth, it is easy to distinguish which will have
wings, by a remarkable fullness of the breast, which in the others
is hardly to be distinguished from the body. When the last covering
is rejected, the wings, which were before folded up in a
very narrow compass, are gradually extended in a surprizing
manner, till their dimensions are at last very considerable.</p>

<p>The increase of these insects in the summer time is so very
great, that by wounding and exhausting the tender shoots, they
would frequently suppress all vegetation, had they not many
enemies to restrain them. Notwithstanding these insects have a
numerous tribe of enemies, they are not without friends, if those
may be considered as such, who are officious in their attendance
for the good things they expect to reap thereby. The ant and
the bee are of this kind, collecting the honey in which the aphides
abound, but with this difference, that the ants are constant
visitors, the bee only when flowers are scarce; the ants will suck<span class="pagenum" id="Page278">[278]</span>
in the honey while the aphides are in the act of discharging it,
the bees only collect it from the leaves on which it has fallen.</p>

<p>In the autumn three more generations of aphides are produced,
two of which generally make their appearance in the month of
August, and the third before the middle of September. The two
first differ in no respect from those which are found in summer;
but the third differs greatly from all the rest. Though all the
aphides which have hitherto appeared were females, in this tenth
generation several male insects are found, but not by any means
so numerous as the females.</p>

<p>The females have at first the same appearance with those of
the former generations, but in a few days their colour changes
from a green to a yellow, which is gradually converted into an
orange before they come to their full growth; they differ also
in another respect from those which occur in summer, for all
these yellow females are without wings. The male insects are,
however, still more remarkable, their outward appearance readily
distinguishing them from this and all other generations.
When first produced, they are not of a green colour like the rest,
but of a reddish brown, and have afterwards a dark line along
the back; they come to their full growth in about three weeks,
and then cast off their last covering, the whole insect being after
this of a bright yellow colour, the wings only excepted; but
after this change to a deeper yellow, and in a very few hours to a
dark brown, if we except the body, which is something lighter
coloured, and has a reddish cast. The males no sooner come to
maturity than they copulate with the females, who in a day or
two after their intercourse with the males lay their eggs, generally
near the buds. Where there are a number crowded together,
they of course interfere with each other, in which case they<span class="pagenum" id="Page279">[279]</span>
will frequently deposit their eggs on other parts of the branches.
It is highly probable that the aphides derive considerable advantages
by living in society; the reiterated punctures of a great
number of them may attract a larger quantity of nutritious juices
to that part of the tree or plant where they have taken up their
abode.</p>

<p>The aphides are very injurious to trees and vegetables of almost
every kind; the species is so numerous, and all endued with so
much fertility, that if they were not destroyed by a numerous
host of enemies, the leaves, the branches, and the stem of every
plant would be covered with them. On almost every leaf inhabited
by aphides, a small worm is to be found, that feeds not
upon the leaves, but upon these insects, devouring them with incredible
rapacity: Reaumur supplied a single worm with above
one-hundred aphides, every one of which it devoured in less than
three hours. Indeed myriads of insects seem to be produced for
no other purpose than to destroy them.</p>

<h3>OF THE APIS OR BEE.</h3>

<p>The bee belongs to the hymenoptera order, the mouth is furnished
with two jaws, and a proboscis protected by a double
sheath, see Fig. 3. <a href="#Plate13">Plate XIII.</a> They have four wings; when
these are at rest, the two foremost cover those behind. There is
a sting in the tail of the working and female bee. Of the bee
kind fifty-five species are enumerated by Linn&aelig;us. Our present
observations are confined to the common or domestic bee.</p>

<p>In the natural history of insects new objects of surprize are
continually rising before the observer: however singular the preceding
account of the production of the aphides may appear, that
of bees is not less so. This little republic has at all times gained<span class="pagenum" id="Page280">[280]</span>
universal esteem and admiration; and, though they have attracted
the attention of the most ingenious and laborious inquirers into
nature, yet the mode of propagating their species seems to have
baffled the ingenuity of ages, and rendered all attempts to discover
it abortive; even the labours and scrupulous attention of
Swammerdam were unsuccessful. He spent one month entirely
in examining, describing, and representing their intestines; and
many months on other parts; employing whole days in making
observations, and whole nights in registering them, till at last he
brought his treatise of bees to the wished for perfection; a work
which, from the commencement of natural history to our own
times, has not its equal. Reaumur, however, thought he had in
some measure removed the veil, and explained their manner of
generating: he supposes the queen bee to be the only female in
the hive, and the mother of the next generation; that the drones
are the males, by which she is fecundated, and that the working
bees, or those that collect wax on the flowers, that knead it, and
form from it the combs and cells, which they afterwards fill with
honey, are of neither sex. The queen bee is known by its size,
being generally much larger than the working bee or the drone.</p>

<p>M. Schirach, a German naturalist, affirms that all the common
bees are females in disguise, in which the organs that distinguish
the sex, and particularly the ovaria, are obliterated, or at least
from their extreme minuteness have escaped the observer&#8217;s eye;
that every one of these bees, in the earlier period of its existence,
is capable of becoming a queen bee, if the whole community
should think it proper to nurse it in a particular manner, and
raise it to that rank: in short, that the queen bee lays only two
kinds of eggs, those that are to produce the drones, and those
from which the working bees are to proceed. Schirach made his
experiments not only in the early spring months, but even as late
as November. He cut off from an old hive a piece of the brood-comb,<span class="pagenum" id="Page281">[281]</span>
taking care that it contained worms which had been
hatched about three days. He fixed this in an empty hive, together
with a piece of honey-comb, for food to his bees, and
then introduced a number of common bees into the hive. As
soon as these found themselves deprived of their queen and their
liberty, a dreadful uproar took place, which lasted for the space
of twenty-four hours. On the cessation of this tumult, they betook
themselves to work, first proceeding to the construction of a
royal cell, and then taking the proper methods for feeding and
hatching the brood inclosed with them; sometimes even on the
second day the foundation of one or more royal cells were to be
perceived; the view of which furnished certain indications that
they had elected one of the inclosed worms to the sovereignty.
The bees may now be left at liberty. The final result of these
experiments is, that the colony of working bees being thus shut
up with a morsel of brood-comb, not only hatch, but at the end
of eighteen or twenty days produce from thence one or two
queens, to all appearance proceeding from worms of the common
sort, converted by them into a queen merely because they wanted
one.<a href="#Footnote82" id="FNanchor82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> From experiments of the same kind, varied and often repeated,
Schirach concludes that all the common working bees
were originally of the female sex; but that if they are not fed,
lodged, and brought up in a particular manner while they are in
the larva state, their organs are not developed; and that it is to
this circumstance attending the bringing up the queen, that the
extension of the female organs is effected, and the difference in
her form and size produced.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote82"><a href="#FNanchor82" class="label">[82]</a> Schirach Histoire Naturelle des Abeilles.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Mr. Debraw has carried the subject further, by discovering the
impregnation of the eggs by the males, and the difference of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page282">[282]</span>
size among the drones or males; though indeed this last circumstance
was not unknown to Mess. Maraldi and Reaumur. Mr.
Debraw watched the glass hives with indefatigable attention,
from the moment the bees, among which he took care there
should be a large number of drones, were put into them, to the
time of the queen&#8217;s laying her eggs, which generally happens on
the fourth or fifth day; he observed, that on the first or second
day, always before the third from the time the eggs are placed
in the cells, a great number of bees, fastening themselves to one
another, hung down in the form of a curtain, from the top to the
bottom of the hive; they had done the same at the time the
queen deposited her eggs, an operation which seems contrived on
purpose to conceal what is transacting; however, through some
parts of this veil he was enabled to see some of the bees inserting
the posterior part of their bodies each into a cell, and sinking
into it, but continuing there only a little while. When they had
retired, it was easy to discover a whitish liquor left in the angle
of the basis of each cell, which contained an egg. In a day or
two this liquor was absorbed into the embryo, which on the
fourth day assumes its worm or larva state, to which the working
bees bring a little honey for nourishment, during the first
eight or ten days after its birth. When the bees find the worm
has attained its full growth, they leave off bringing it food, they
know it has no more need of it; they have still, however, another
service to pay it, in which they never fail; it is that of shutting it
up in its cell, where the larva is inclosed for eight or ten days:
here a further change takes place; the larva, which was heretofore
idle, now begins to work, and lines its cell with fine silk,
while the working bee incloses it exteriorly with a wax covering.
The concealed larva then voids its excrement, quits its skin, and
assumes the pupa; at the end of some days the young bee acquires
sufficient strength to quit the slender covering of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page283">[283]</span>
pupa, tears the wax covering of its cell, and proceeds a perfect
insect.</p>

<p>To prove further that the eggs are fecundated by the males, and
that their presence is necessary at the time of breeding, Mr. Debraw
made the following experiments. They consist in leaving
in a hive the queen, with only the common or working bees,
without any drones, to see whether the eggs she laid would be
prolific. To this end he took a swarm, and shook all the bees
into a tub of water, leaving them there till they were quite senseless;
by which means he could distinguish the drones without any
danger of being stung: he then restored the queen and working
bees to their former state, by spreading them on a brown paper
in the sun; after this he replaced them in a glass hive, where
they soon began to work as usual. The queen laid eggs, which,
to his great surprize, were impregnated, for he imagined he had
separated all the drones or males, and therefore omitted watching
them; at the end of twenty days he found several of his eggs had,
in the usual course of changes, produced bees, while some had
withered away, and others were covered with honey. Hence he
inferred, that some of the males had escaped his notice, and impregnated
part of the eggs. To convince himself of this, he took
away all the brood-comb that was in the hive, in order to oblige
the bees to provide a fresh quantity, being determined to watch
narrowly their motions after new eggs should be laid in the cells.
On the second day after the eggs were deposited, he perceived the
same operation that was mentioned before, namely, that of the
bees hanging down in the form of a curtain, while others thrust
the posterior part of their bodies into the cells. He then introduced
his hand into the hive, broke off a piece of the comb, in
which there were two of these insects; he found in neither of
them any sting, a circumstance peculiar to the drones; upon dissection,<span class="pagenum" id="Page284">[284]</span>
with the assistance of a microscope, he discovered the
four cylindrical bodies which contain the glutinous liquor of a
whitish colour, as observed by Maraldi in the large drones. He
was therefore now under the necessity of repeating his experiments,
in destroying the males, and even those that might be suspected
to be such. He once more immersed the same bees in
water, and when they appeared in a senseless state, he gently
pressed every one, in order to distinguish those armed with stings
from those which had none, and which of course he supposed to
be males: of these last he found fifty-seven, and replaced the
swarm in a glass hive, where they immediately applied again to
the work of making cells, and on the fourth or fifth day, very
early in the morning, he had the pleasure to see the queen bee
deposit her eggs in those cells: he continued watching most part
of the ensuing days, but could discover nothing of what he had
seen before.</p>

<p>The eggs, after the fourth day, instead of changing in the
manner of caterpillars, were found in the same state they were in
the first day, except that some were covered with honey. A singular
event happened the next day, about noon; all the bees left
their own hive, and were seen attempting to get into a neighbouring
one, on the stool of which the queen was found dead, being
no doubt slain in the engagement. This event seems to have
arisen from the great desire of perpetuating their species, and to
which end the concurrence of the males seems so absolutely necessary;
it made them desert their habitations, where no males
were left, in order to fix a residence in a new one, in which there
was a good stock of them. To be further satisfied, Mr. Debraw
took the brood-comb, which had not been impregnated, and divided
it into two parts; one he placed under a glass bell, No. 1,
with honey-comb for the bees food, taking care to leave a queen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page285">[285]</span>
but no drones, among the bees confined in it; the other piece of
the brood-comb he placed under another glass bell, No. 2, with a
few drones, a queen, and a proportionable number of common
bees. The result was, that in the glass, No. 1, there was no impregnation,
the eggs remaining in the same state they were in
when put into the glass; and on giving the bees their liberty on
the seventh day, they all flew away as was found to be the case
in the former experiment; whereas in the glass, No. 2, the very
day after the bees had been put into it, the eggs were impregnated
by the drones, and the bees did not leave their hive on receiving
their liberty.</p>

<p>The editor of the Cyclop&aelig;dia says, that the small drones are all
dead before the end of May, when the larger species appear, and
supersede their use; and that it is not without reason that a modern
author suggests, that a small number of drones are reserved
to supply the necessities of the ensuing year; but that they are
very little, if any, larger than the common bee.</p>

<p>It does not enter into our plan to notice further in this place
the wonders of this little society. A bee-hive is certainly one of
the finest objects that can offer itself to the eyes of the beholder.
It is not easy to be weary of contemplating those workshops,
where thousands of labourers are constantly engaged in different
employments.<a href="#Footnote83" id="FNanchor83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote83"><a href="#FNanchor83" class="label">[83]</a> The remarks made
by the late Mr. Hunter on the experiments of Messrs. Schirach and
Debraw, in my opinion, merit the attention of the reader; they are contained in his &#8220;Observations
on Bees,&#8221; comprizing a variety of information respecting the history and &#339;conomy of
those curious insects. This ingenious and interesting account is inserted in the Philosophical
Transactions for the year 1792, page 128-195. I cannot altogether subscribe to his opinion
relative to the minuteness and prolixity of Swammerdam. <span class="smcap">Edit.</span></p>

<h3>OF THE EGGS OF INSECTS.</h3>

<p>The eggs are contained and arranged in the body of the insect,
in vessels which vary in number and figure in different species;
the same variety is found in the eggs themselves: some are round,
others oval, some cylindrical, and others nearly square; the shells
of some are hard and smooth, while others are soft and flexible.
It is a general rule, that eggs do not increase in size after they
are laid; among insects, we find however an exception to this;
the eggs of the tenthredo of Linn&aelig;us increase after they are laid,
but their shell is soft and membranaceous. The eggs of insects
differ in their colours; some may be found of almost every shade,
of yellow, green, brown, and even black. The eggs of the lion
puceron,<a href="#Footnote84" id="FNanchor84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> hemerobius, Lin. are very singular objects, and cannot
have escaped the eye of any person who is conversant among the
insects which live on trees; though of the many who have seen
them, few, if any, have found what they really were. It is
common to see on the leaves and pedicles of the leaves of the
plumb-tree, and several other trees, as also on their young
branches, a number of long and slender filaments, running out
to about an inch in length; ten or twelve of these are usually
seen placed near one another, and a vast number of these clusters
are found on the same tree; each of these filaments is terminated
by a sort of swelling or tubercle of the shape of an egg. They
have generally been supposed to be of vegetable origin, and
that they were a sort of parasitical plant growing out of others.
There is a time when these egg-like balls are found open at the
ends; in this state they very much resemble flowers, and have
been figured as such by some authors, though they are only the<span class="pagenum" id="Page287">[287]</span>
shells of the eggs out of which the young animals have escaped
after being hatched. If these eggs be examined by a microscope,
a worm may be discovered in them; or they may be put
into a box, in which, in due time, they will produce an insect,
which, when viewed with a microscope, will be found to be the
true lion puceron.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Divine Providence instructs the insects, by a lower species of
perception, to deposit their eggs not only in safety from their
numerous enemies, but also in situations where a sufficient quantity
of food is on the spot to support and nourish the larva immediately
on breaking the shell. Some deposit their eggs in the
oak leaf, producing there the red gall; others choose the leaf of
the poplar, which swells into a red node or bladder; to a similar
cause we must attribute the red knob which is often seen on the
willow leaf, and the three pointed protuberances upon the termination
of the juniper branches. The leaves of the veronica and
cerastium are drawn into a globular head by the eggs of an insect
lodged therein. The phal&aelig;na neustria glues its eggs with great
symmetry and propriety round the smaller branches of trees.
Fig. 1. <a href="#Plate10">Plate X.</a> represents a magnified view of the nest of
eggs taken off the tree after the caterpillar had eaten its way
through them; the strong ground-work of gum, by which they
are connected and bound together, is very visible in many places;
they strengthen this connection further, by filling up all the intervening
space between the eggs with a very tenacious substance.
These eggs are crustaceous, and similar to those of the hen;
Fig. 2 represents the natural size. Fig. 3 is a magnified vertical
section of the eggs, shewing their oval shape; Fig. 4 the natural
size. Fig. 5 is an horizontal section through the middle of the
egg, and Fig. 6 the same not magnified. It is not easy to describe
the beauty of these objects, when viewed in the lucernal microscope;
the regularity with which they are placed, the delicacy<span class="pagenum" id="Page288">[288]</span>
of their texture, the beautiful and ever-varying colours which
they present to the eye, give the spectator a high degree of rational
delight.</p>

<p>In the Lapland Alps there is a fly covered with a downy hair,
called the rhen-deer gad-fly, oestrus tarandi, Linn. it hovers all
day over these animals, whose legs tremble under them; they
prick up their ears, and flee to the mountains covered with ice
and snow to escape from a little hovering fly, but generally in
vain, for the insect but too soon finds an opportunity to lodge its
egg in the back of the deer; the worm hatched from this egg
perforates the skin, and remains under it during the whole
winter: in the following year it becomes a fly. The oestrus bovis
is an equal terror to oxen; the hippobosca equina, to horses;
oestrus ovis,<a href="#Footnote85" id="FNanchor85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> to the sheep, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="footnote">

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The gnat, the ephemera, the phryganea, the libellula, hover
over the water all day to drop their eggs, which are hatched in
the water, and continue there all the time they are in the larva
form. The mass formed by the gnat resembles a little vessel set
afloat by the insect; each egg is in the form of a keel, these are
curiously connected together. The gnat lays but one egg at a
time, which she deposits on the water in a very ingenious and
simple manner; she stretches her legs out, and crosses them, thus
forming an angle to receive and hold the first egg; a second egg
is soon placed next the first; then a third, and so on, till the base
is capable of supporting itself; these, as they come to maturity,
sink deeper. The spawn of this insect is sometimes above an
inch long, and one-eighth of an inch in diameter, and tied by a
little stem or stalk to some stick or stone. Sometimes they are
laid in a single, sometimes in a double spiral line; sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page289">[289]</span>
transversely. Many moths cover their offspring with a thick bed
of hair, which they gather from their own body; while others
cover them with a glutinous composition, which, when hard,
protects them from moisture, rain, and cold. The gall-flies, it
has been observed, know how to open the nerves of the leaves, to
deposit thus their eggs in a place which afterwards serves them
for a lodging and a magazine of food. The solitary bees and
wasps prepare an habitation for their little ones in the earth,
placing there a proper quantity of food for them, when they proceed
from the egg. The voracious and cruel spider is attentive
and careful of its eggs; the wolf spider carries them on its back
in a little bag formed of its silk, it cannot be separated from
them but by violence, and exhibits the most marked signs of uneasiness
when deprived of them: a circumstance the more remarkable,
as they love to destroy each other, and even carry on
their courtships with a diffidence and caution unknown in any
other species of animals. The history of bees and wasps, and
their care and attention to their offspring, is so well known, that
I may with propriety pass it over here, and proceed just to notice
the industrious ant, whose paternal affection and care is not
so well known. They are not satisfied with placing their eggs
in situations made on purpose, and to raise or rear them till
they come to the nymph or pupa state, but they even extend
their care to the pup&aelig; themselves, removing them from their
nest to the surface of the earth, whenever the weather is fine,
that they may receive the benignant influence of the sun, carrying
them back again as soon as the air begins to grow cold. If
any accident disturb their nest, and disperse the pup&aelig;, they manifest
the greatest signs of distress, seeking those which are lost
and scattered, placing them in some sheltered place while they
repair the nest, when they again transport them to it.<a href="#Footnote86" id="FNanchor86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
Many<span class="pagenum" id="Page290">[290]</span>
other curious particulars might be related relative to this industrious
insect; as their uniting together in scooping out earth, the
conveyance of materials for the construction of their nests, and
the curious structure of the nest itself, which, though it appears
piled up at random, will be found, on stricter examination, to be
a work of art and design, with other circumstances which are too
long to be enumerated here.</p>

<p>The fecundity of insects exceeds in an astonishing degree that
of all the productions of nature; the vegetables which cover the
surface of the earth bear no proportion to their multitudes, every
plant supporting a number often of scarce perceptible creatures:
of the fatal effects of their prodigious multiplication, our fruit
trees, &amp;c. are too frequently a deplorable testimony. On the continent
whole provinces sometimes languish in consequence of
the dreadful havoc made by them.</p>

<p>Reaumur calculated the fecundity of the queen bee as follows:
he found that she laid in the two months of March and April
12,000 eggs, so that the swarm which left the hive in May consisted
of near 12,000 bees, all produced from one mother: but
this calculation falls short of that which was made by Leeuwenhoek
on a fly, whose larva feeds on flesh, putrid carcases, &amp;c.
which multiply prodigiously, and that in a short space of time.
One of these laid 144 eggs, from which he got as many flies in
the first month; so that, supposing one-half of these to be females,
in the third month we shall have 746,496, all produced in
three months from one fly.</p>

<p>The following is an experiment of M. Lyonet on the generation
of a moth which comes from the chenille a brosse: out of a
brood of 350 eggs, produced by a single moth of this kind, he
took 80, from which he obtained, when they were arrived at<span class="pagenum" id="Page291">[291]</span>
their perfect state, 15 females; from whence he deduces the following
consequence: if 80 eggs give 15 females, the whole brood
of 350 would have produced 65; these 65, supposing them as
fertile as their mother, would have produced 22,750 caterpillars,
among which there would have been at least 4265 females, who
would have produced for the third generation 1,492,750 caterpillars.
This number would have been much larger, if the number
of females among those which were selected by M. Lyonet
had been greater. M. de Geer counted in the belly of a moth
480 eggs; reducing these to 400, if supposing one-fourth only of
these to be females and as fruitful as their mother, they will give
birth to 40,000 caterpillars for the second generation; and for the
third, supposing all things equal, four millions of caterpillars. It
is not surprizing, therefore, that they are found so numerous in
years that are favourable to their propagation. But the Creator
of all things has for our sakes limited this abundant multiplication,
and wisely ordained, that those species which are the most
numerous shall have the greatest number of enemies, who, though
constantly employed on the destruction of individuals, are unable
to effect that of the species; by which means an equilibrium is
preserved, and no one species preponderates. Few insects live
long after their last transformation, but their species are continued
by their amazing fecundity; their growth is completed, and
their parts hardened sooner than those of larger animals, and the
duration of their existence is proportionably limited. There are,
however some species of flies which lie in a torpid state during
the winter, and revive with the returning warmth of spring.</p>

<h3>OF THE FOOD OF INSECTS.</h3>

<p>There are few, if any, productions either of the animal or vegetable
kingdoms, which do not supply some kind of insect with
food. They may, therefore, be considered under two heads, those<span class="pagenum" id="Page292">[292]</span>
which live on vegetables, and those which are supported by animal
food; each insect knows that which is proper to sustain its
life, where to seek it, and how to procure it. I have already
observed, that several insects, when arrived at a state of perfection,
feed after their transformation upon food totally different
from that which nourished them in their larva state.</p>

<p>Among those which feed on vegetables, some sink themselves
in the earth, and by destroying the roots of the plants, do considerable
injuries to our gardens. The food of others is dry and
hard; they pierce the wood, reduce it to powder, and then feed
on it; some, as the cossus, attack and destroy the trees, while the
food of others more delicate is the leaves. The leaf is eaten in a
different manner by different insects; some eat the whole substance,
while others feed only on the parenchymous parts, which
are contained between its superficial membranes, forming withinside
the leaf paths and galleries. These insects are not always
content with the leaf, but attack the flower also: even this food
is too gross for many; the bee, the butterfly, the moth, as well as
several species of flies, feed only on the honey, or finer juices,
which they collect from flowers. We are continually finding the
larva of some insect in pears, plumbs, peaches, and other fruit;
these unwelcome intruders on the produce of human industry
divide fruits, grain, and corn with us, often depriving us of large
quantities. There is, indeed, no part of a plant which does not
serve as food to different insects; some have one kind of plant
marked out for them to inhabit and feed on, others have another
assigned to them, on which, and no other, they will feed; each
has its appropriate food, and though the parent animal eats not
at all, or lives upon food entirely different, yet she is guided, as
has before been observed, to deposit her eggs on that peculiar
shrub or plant that will be food for her young; while some, more
voracious than the rest, feed upon all with equal avidity; but in<span class="pagenum" id="Page293">[293]</span>
countries less cultivated than our own, their annoyance and devastations
are terrible. The gryllus migratorius, a few years
since, poured out of Tartary in such quantities, as to lay waste a
great part of Europe, producing almost unequalled calamities,
swarming in such multitudes as to cloud the air and cover the
ground, mocking human power and craft; wherever they settled,
all verdure disappeared, and the summer fruitfulness was turned
into winter desolation; in Sweden the cattle perished with hunger,
and the men were forced to abandon their country, and fly
to the neighbouring regions.<a href="#Footnote87" id="FNanchor87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> The far greater part feed only,
however, on one species of plant, or at most on those which are
similar to it, and the same species may always be found on the
same plant. Reaumur says, that the caterpillar which infests and
feeds upon the cabbage, destroys in twenty-four hours more
than twice its weight. If larger animals required a proportionable
quantity, the earth would not afford sufficient nourishment
for its inhabitants.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>A great number of insects reject vegetable, and live on animal
food; some seeking that which is beginning to putrefy, while
others delight in food entirely putrid; others again are nourished
by the most filthy puddles, and disgusting excrements; some attack
and feed on man himself, while others are nourished by
his provision, his cloaths, his furniture: some prey upon insects
of another species; others, again, attack their own, and harrass
each other with perpetual carnage. Reaumur informs us, that
those insects which feed upon dead carcases never attack living
animals; the flesh-fly deposits her eggs in the bodies of dead animals,
where her progeny receive that nourishment best adapted
for them; but this fly never attempts to lay her eggs in the flesh
of sound and living animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page294">[294]</span></p>

<p>Every animal has its appropriate lice, which feed on and infest
it. M. Rhedi has given an accurate account of a great number
of these little noxious creatures accompanied with figures; but,
as if it were not sufficient that these creatures should dwell and
live on the external part of the body, and suck the blood of the
animal that they infest, we find another species of insects seeking
their food in the more vital parts, and feeding on the flesh of
the animal, while full of life and health. Reaumur has given an
history of a fly, oestrus bovis, the larva of which lives upon the
backs, and feeds on the flesh of young oxen and cows, where it
produces a kind of tumor. The fly lodges its eggs in the flesh,
by making a number of little wounds, in each of which it deposits
eggs, so that every wound becomes a nest, the eggs of
which are hatched by the heat of the animal. Here the larv&aelig;
find abundant food, at the same time that they are protected from
the changes of the weather; and here they stay till they are fit
for transformation. The parts they inhabit are often easy to be
discovered by a kind of lump or tumor, which they form by their
ravages; this tumor suppurates, and is filled with matter; on this
disgusting substance the larv&aelig; feed, and their heads are always
found plunged in it.<a href="#Footnote88" id="FNanchor88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote88"><a href="#FNanchor88" class="label">[88]</a> The obscure
and singular habitations of the British oestri are the stomach and intestines of
the horse, the frontal and maxillary sinuses of sheep, and beneath the skin of the backs of
horned cattle. In other parts of the world they inhabit various other animals.</p>

<p>The larva of the oestrus bovis lives beneath the skin of horned cattle, between it and the
cellular membrane, in a proper sack or abcess, which is rather larger than the insect, and by
narrowing upwards opens externally to the air by a small aperture. When arrived at its full
growth, it effects its escape from the abcess by pressing against the external opening; when the
opening has thus obtained the size of a small pea, the larva writhes itself through, and falls
from the back of the animal to the ground; and, seeking a convenient retreat, becomes a chrysalis,
in which state it continues from about the latter end of June to about the middle of
August; the perfect insect, on leaving the chrysalis, forces open a very remarkable marginated
triangular lid or operculum. The oestrus in its perfect or fly state is the largest of the European
species of this genus, and is very beautiful. Although its effects on the cattle have been so often
remarked, yet the fly itself is rarely seen or taken, as the attempt would be attended with
considerable danger. The pain it inflicts in depositing its egg is much more severe than in any
of the other species: when one of the cattle is attacked by this fly, it is easily known by the extreme
terror and agitation of the whole herd; the unfortunate object of the attack runs bellowing
from among them to some distant part of the heath, or the nearest water, while the tail, from
the severity of the pain, is held with a tremulous motion straight from the body, in the direction
of the spine, and the head and neck are also stretched out to the utmost. The rest, from fear,
generally follow to the water, and disperse to different parts of the field. The larv&aelig; of this
insect are mostly known among the country people by the name of wornuls, wormuls, or warbles,
or more properly bots.</p>

<p>The larva of the oestrus equi is very commonly found in the stomach of horses. These larv&aelig;
attach themselves to every part of the stomach, but are generally most numerous about the pylorus;
and are sometimes found in the intestines. They hang most commonly in clusters, being
fixed by the small end to the inner membrane of the stomach, to which they adhere by two small
hooks or tentacula. The larv&aelig; having attained their full growth in about a month, on dropping
to the ground find some convenient retreat, change to the chrysalis, and in about six or
seven weeks the fly appears.</p>

<p>The larva of the oestrus h&aelig;morrhoidalis resembles in almost every respect that of the oestrus
equi, and occupies the same situation in the stomach of the horse. When it is ripe, and has
passed through the intestines and the sphincter ani it assumes the chrysalis state in about two
days, and in about two months the fly appears.</p>

<p>The generally received opinion has been that the female fly enters the anus of the horse to
deposit its eggs, and Reaumur relates this circumstance on the authority of Dr. Gaspari; from
the account of its getting beneath the tail, it is probable that the fly he saw was the hippobosca
equina, which frequently does this: its getting within the rectum appears to have been additional.
That a fly might deposit its eggs on the verge of the anus is not impossible, but we
know no instance of it: the fact is, that the part chosen by the oestrus h&aelig;morrhoidalis for this
purpose is the lips of the horse, which is very distressing to the animal from the excessive titillation
it occasions; for he immediately after rubs his mouth against the ground, his fore legs,
or sometimes against a tree, or if two are standing together, they often rub themselves against
each other. At the sight of this fly, the horse appears much agitated, and moves its head backward
and forward in the air to baulk its touch, and prevent its darting on the lips; but the fly,
watching for a favourable opportunity, continues to repeat the operation; till at length, the
enraged animal endeavours to avoid it by galloping away to a distant part of the field. If still
pursued, its last resource is in the water, where the oestrus is never observed to follow him.</p>

<p>The oestrus veterinus is by Linn&aelig;us called nasalis, from an idea of its entering the nostrils
of the horse to deposit its eggs, which it could not well do without destroying its wings, and is
therefore probably as much a fable as the &#8220;mire per anum intrans&#8221; of the oestrus h&aelig;morrhoidalis.</p>

<p>The oestrus ovis is mostly found in the horns and frontal sinuses of the sheep, though it has
been remarked that the membranes lining these cavities were hardly at all inflamed, while
those of the maxillary sinuses were highly so; from which it is suspected that they inhabit the
maxillary sinuses, and crawl, on the death of the animal, into these situations in the horns and
frontal sinuses. When the larv&aelig; are full-grown they fall through the nostrils, and change to the
pupa state, lying on the earth, or adhering by the side to a blade of grass. The fly bursts the shell
of the pupa in about two months.</p>

<p>The above concise account of the different oestri is extracted from the excellent paper on the
subject by Mr. B. Clark, F. L. S. For his more ample description, accompanied with coloured
figures of the several British species, see Transactions of the Linnean Society, vol. iii. page

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page295">[295]</span></p>

<p>Neither the larva, pupa, or even the egg-state of some insects
are exempt from the attacks of others, who deposit their eggs in
them; these, after having passed through the usual transformations,
become what is termed the ichneumon fly. The following
are the curious observations of an ingenious naturalist on this fly.
&#8220;As I was observing,&#8221; says he, &#8220;one day some caterpillars
which were feeding voluptuously on a cabbage leaf, my attention
was attracted to part of the plant, about which a little fly was
buzzing on its wing, as if deliberating where to settle: I was
surprized to see the herd of caterpillars, creatures of twenty times
its size, endeavouring in an uncouth manner, by various contortions<span class="pagenum" id="Page296">[296]</span>
of the body to get out of its way, and more so whenever the
fly poised on the wing as if going to drop; at length the creature
made its choice, and seated itself on the back of one of the
largest and fairest of the cluster; it was in vain the unhappy
reptile endeavoured to dislodge the enemy. If the caterpillar
had shewn terror on the approach of the fly, its anguish at intervals
now seemed intolerable, and I soon found that it was in
consequence of the strokes or wounds given by the fly. At
every wound the poor caterpillar wreathed and twisted its whole
frame, endeavouring to disengage itself, by shaking off the enemy,
sometimes aiming its mouth towards the place; but it was all in<span class="pagenum" id="Page297">[297]</span>
vain; its little, but cruel tormentor kept its place. When it had
inflicted thirty or forty of these wounds, it took its flight with a
visible triumph; in each of these wounds the little fly had deposited
an egg. I took the caterpillar home with me, to observe
the progress of the eggs which were thus placed in its body, taking
care to give it a fresh supply of leaves from time to time; it
recovered to all appearance in a few hours from the wounds it
had received, and from that time, for the space of four or five
days, seemed to feed with its usual avidity. The eggs were
all hatched into small oblong voracious worms, which fed from
the moment of their appearance on the flesh of the caterpillar,
in whose body they were inclosed, and seemingly without
wounding the organs of respiration or digestion; and when they
had arrived at their full growth, they eat their way out of the
sides of the animal, at the same time destroying it. The caterpillar
thus attacked by the larva of the ichneumon never escapes,
its destruction is infallible; but then its life is not taken away at
once; the larva, while it is feeding thereon, knows how to spare
the parts which are essential to its life, because its own is at that
time tied up in that of the caterpillar. No butterfly is produced
from it; the worms that feed on the wretched creature, are no
sooner out of its body, than every one spins its own web, and
under this they pass the state of rest necessary to introduce them
to their winged form.&#8221;<a href="#Footnote89" id="FNanchor89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> To treat of each species of the ichneumon
would alone fill a volume; Linn&aelig;us enumerates no less than
seventy-seven of them.<a href="#Footnote90" id="FNanchor90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote90"><a href="#FNanchor90" class="label">[90]</a> &#8220;The genus of insects
called ichneumon derive their support and nourishment from other
insects, some depositing their eggs in the larva, others again in the pupa, and some even in the
ovum or egg itself, the contents of which, minute as they are, are sufficient to support the young
larv&aelig; until their change into their pupa state. Some deposit only one egg in a place, as the
ichneumon ovulorum, and others again a great number, as ichneumon puparum, &amp;c. but whether
the egg be placed in the pupa, larva, or ovum, the destruction of the foster parent is
inevitable. The larv&aelig; of large moths or butterflies that have been wounded by an ichneumon,
live and feed, though with evident marks of disease, until those parasites are full fed, and able to
change into their second or pupa state.&#8221; See Observations on the &#338;conomy of the Ichneumon
Manifestator, in the Transactions of the Linnean Society, vol. 3, p. 23 &amp; seq. by T. Marsham,
Esq. Sec. L. S. <span class="smcap">Edit.</span></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Of this strange scene it is difficult for us to form a proper
judgment; we are unacquainted with the organs of the caterpillar,<span class="pagenum" id="Page298">[298]</span>
ignorant of the nature of its sensations, and therefore we
cannot be assured what may be the effects of that which we see
it suffer. &#8220;It is wisdom to suppose we are ignorant, while we
know the Creator cannot be cruel.&#8221; From revelation we learn,
that man is the mean through which life is conveyed to the creatures
of this lower world; that by sinking into error, and fostering
evil, he perverts his own life, and corrupts all that which
proceeds from him: so that the effects are the same on the orders
beneath him, as would arise to the world if a continual cloud was
placed between us and the sun, depriving us at once of the salutary
effects of its invigorating heat and cheering light. Hence
there is in this degraded world an obscure and melancholy shade
cast over all the beauties of creation.</p>

<p>Lastly, the number of insects which feed upon others, nay,
some even upon their own species, is very great: it is among
these that we find the traces of the greatest art and cunning, as
well in attack as defence; some indeed use main force alone. Most
persons are acquainted with the dexterous arts of the spider, the
curious construction of the web he spins, and the central position
he takes, in order to watch more effectually the least motion
that may be communicated to its tender net. Those who wish
to pursue this subject further, will find ample satisfaction by
consulting the works of Reaumur and De Geer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page299">[299]</span></p>

<h3>OF THE HABITATION OF INSECTS.</h3>

<p>Insects may be divided, with respect to their habitations, into
two classes, aquatic and terrestrial.</p>

<p>Stagnant waters are generally filled with insects, who live
therein in different manners. These are, 1. Aquatic insects which
remain always on the superficies of the water, or which at least
plunge themselves therein but rarely. 2. Others that live only
in the water, and cannot subsist out of it. 3. Many, after having
lived in the water while in the larva and pupa state, quit it afterwards
with wings, and become entirely terrestrial. 4. Some
undergo all their transformations in the water, and then become
amphibious. 5. Others again are born and grow in the water,
but undergo their pupa state on dry land, and after they are arrived
at their perfect state, live equally in air and water; and
6. There are some who live at the same time part in the water
and part on land, but after their transformation cease to be
aquatic.</p>

<p>Among the insects which remain on the superficies of the
water, are some spiders, which run with great address and agility,
without moistening their feet or their body; when they
repose themselves, they extend their feet as much as possible.
There are also aquatic bugs, which swim, or rather run on the
water with great velocity, and by troops; another bug walks
very slowly on the water; the gyrinus moves very swiftly, and in
circles. There is a species of podura<a href="#Footnote91" id="FNanchor91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> which live in society, and
are often accumulated together in little black lumps. Those insects
which always live in the water are generally born with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page300">[300]</span>
figure which they retain during their whole lives, as the monoculi,
crabs, several kinds of water mites, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote91"><a href="#FNanchor91" class="label">[91]</a> De Geer Discours sur les Insectes, tom. 2, p. 103.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Those insects which, after having lived in the water, leave it
when in a winged state, are very numerous: among these we
may reckon the libellula, the ephemera, the phryganea, culices,
tipul&aelig;, and some species of musc&aelig;. All these, when in the larva
and pupa state, live in the water; but when they have assumed
their perfect form, are entirely terrestrial, and would perish in
their former element.</p>

<p>The notonecta, the nepa or aquatic scorpion, &amp;c. never quit
the water till they have passed through all their transformations,
when they become amphibious, generally quitting it in the
evening.</p>

<p>The water-beetles, of which there are many species, remain in
the water all day, but toward evening come upon the ground and
fly about, then plunge themselves again in the water at the approach
of the rising sun. The larv&aelig; of these insects are entirely
aquatic, but when the time of their pupa state arrives, they take
to the earth, where they make a spherical case; so that these
insects are aquatic in the larva, terrestrial in the pupa, and amphibious
in the imago state.</p>

<p>We find an instance of an insect that lives at the same time in
the water and the air, in the singular larva described by Reaumur,
Memoires de l&#8217;Acad. in 1714, p. 203. It has the head and tail in
the water, while the rest of the body is continually kept above
the surface. In order to support itself in this singular position,
it bends the body, bringing the head near the tail, raising the rest
above the water, and supporting itself against some fixed object,
as a plant, or against the borders of the pond; or, if it be placed<span class="pagenum" id="Page301">[301]</span>
in a glass vessel, against the sides of the vessel; and if the glass
be inclined gently, so that the water may nearly cover the larva,
it immediately changes its position, in order that part of the body
may be kept dry.</p>

<p>At the baths of Abano, a small town in the Venetian state,
there is a multitude of springs, strongly impregnated with sulphur,
and of a boiling heat. In the midst of these boiling springs,
within three feet of four or five of them, there is a tepid one
about blood-warm. In this water, not only the common potamogetons
and confervas, or pond-weeds and water-mosses are
found growing in an healthy state, but numbers of small black
water beetles are seen swimming about, which die on being
taken out and plunged suddenly into cold water.<a href="#Footnote92" id="FNanchor92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote92"><a href="#FNanchor92" class="label">[92]</a> Jones&#8217;s Physiological Disquisitions, p. 171.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Many insects that live under the surface of the earth crawl out
on certain occasions, as the julus, scolopendra, and the oniscus;
they are often also to be found under stones, or pieces of rotten
wood. Some insects remain under ground part of their life, but
quit that situation after their change; as do some caterpillars,
many of the coleoptera class, &amp;c. There are some species of spiders,
which form habitations in sand; one of which makes a
hole in the sand, lining it with a kind of silk, to prevent its
crumbling away; this spider generally keeps on the watch near
the mouth of the hole, and, if a fly approach, runs at it with such
velocity, as seldom to fail in its attempt of seizing the little animal,
which is immediately conveyed to the den of the spider.
The formica-leo, or ant-lion, also inhabits sand.<a href="#Footnote93" id="FNanchor93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote93"><a href="#FNanchor93" class="label">[93]</a> The art and dexterity with
which the formica-leo entraps ants, as well as other insects,
merits notice; he makes a pit in fine dry sand, shaped like a funnel or an inverted cone, at the
point or reverted apex of which he takes his station, concealing every part of his body except
the tips of his two horns; these are expanded to the two sides of the pit. When an insect
treads on the edge of this precipice, it perhaps slides into it; if not, its steps remove a little of
the sand, which of course descends down the sides, and gives the enemy notice of his prey.
He then throws up the sand with which his head is covered, to involve the insect, and bring
it to the bottom with the returning force of the sand: this, by repeated efforts he is sure to
effect, as all the attempts of the unfortunate victim to escape, when once within the verge of
the pit, are in vain. One species of the formica-leo forms no pit to entrap its prey, but
seizes it by main force. <span class="smcap">Edit.</span></p>

<p>Another spider, discovered by M. l&#8217;Abbe Sauvage,<a href="#Footnote94" id="FNanchor94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> burrows in
the earth like a rabbit, making a hole one or two feet deep, of a
regular diameter, and sufficiently large to move itself with ease.
It lines the whole of it, either to keep the ground from tumbling
in, or in order to perceive more regularly at the bottom what
happens at the mouth, at which it forms a kind of door, made of
different layers of earth, connected together by threads and covered
with a strong web of a close texture; the threads are prolonged
on one side, and fixed to the ground, so as to form a strong
joint; the door is hung in such a manner, as always to fall by its
own gravity. One of these cases or nests is in her Majesty&#8217;s cabinet
at Kew.</p>

mention some of those in whom industry and art is more strongly
marked to our eyes than in others.</p>

<p>Among the solitary bees there are so many curious circumstances
to be described, that a single volume would not suffice to
contain the particulars; we shall here only relate such as concern
their habitations. One of these forms its nest under ground,
which is composed of several cells artfully let into each other, but
not covered with a common inclosure; each cell consists of two
or three membranes, inexpressibly fine, and placed over each
other. The cavity, in which the nest is placed, is smeared over
with a layer of matter, like that of which the cells are formed,
and apparently similar to the viscous humour which snails spread
in their passage from one place to another, and it is probable that
they are formed of the same materials; this substance, though of
so delicate a nature, gives them such a degree of consistency, that
they may be handled without altering their form. An egg is
deposited at the bottom of each cell, where, after it is hatched,
the worm finds itself in the midst of a plentiful stock of provision;
for in each cell there is placed a quantity of paste, or a kind of
wax, which is to serve as food for the worm, and support the
wall of the cell. The worm is also instructed so to conduct
itself, and eat this food, as to leave sufficient props for supporting
the walls of its apartment. Many species of these bees content
themselves with penetrating into the earth, scooping out hollow
cavities therein, polishing the walls, then depositing an egg and a
sufficient quantity of provisions.</p>

<p>There is another species, that forms its nest under ground with
remarkable industry; this bee generally makes a perpendicular
hole in the earth about three inches deep, and cylindrical, till
within about three-fourths of an inch of the bottom, when it
begins to enlarge; as soon as the bee has given it the suitable<span class="pagenum" id="Page304">[304]</span>
proportions, it proceeds to line not only the whole inside of its
dwelling, but round the entrance; the substance with which it is
lined is of a crimson colour, and looks like satin. From this circumstance
Reaumur<a href="#Footnote95" id="FNanchor95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> terms it the tapestry bee. This tapestry
or lining is formed of fragments of the flowers of the wild poppy,
which she cuts out curiously, and then seizing them with her
legs, conveys them to her nest. If the pieces are wrinkled, she
first straightens and then affixes them to her walls with wonderous
art; she generally applies two layers of these fragments one
over the other. If the piece she has cut and transported be too
large for the place she intends it for, she clips off the superfluous
parts and conveys the shreds out of the apartment. After the
bee has lined her cell, she fills it nearly half an inch deep with
a paste proper to nourish the larva when hatched from the egg;
when the bee has amassed a sufficient quantity of paste, she then
takes her tapestry, and folds it over the paste and egg, which are
by these means inclosed as it were in a bag of paste; this done,
she fills up with earth the empty space that is above the bag.
There is another bee which does the same with rose-leaves, and
in the substance of a thick post. A friend of mine had a piece
of wood cut from a strong post that supported the roof of a
cart-house, full of these cells or round holes, three-eighths of an
inch in diameter, and about three-fourths deep, each of which
was filled with these rose-leaf cases finely covered in at top
and bottom.</p>

<p>The mason bee is so called by Reaumur from the manner of its
building its nest. These bees collect with their jaws small parcels
of earth and sand, which they glue together with a strong
cement furnished from the proboscis; and of this they form a
simple but commodious habitation, which is generally placed<span class="pagenum" id="Page305">[305]</span>
along walls that are exposed to the south. Each nest resembles
a lump of rude earth, of about six or seven inches diameter,
thrown against the wall; the labour of constructing so large an
edifice must be very great, as the bee can only carry a few grains
at a time. The exterior form is rude and irregular, but the construction
and art exhibited in the interior parts make up for this
seeming defect; it is generally divided into twelve or fifteen cells,
separated from each other by a thick wall; in each of these an
egg is deposited by the parent bee. The cells are not constructed
all at once, for when one is finished, she places an egg therein,
with a sufficient quantity of honey to nourish the larva; she
then builds another. When the insect is arrived at a proper
state, it penetrates through its inclosures by means of its strong
jaws. When all the bees have quitted the nest, there are as
many holes on the surface thereof as there are cells within. We
find no neutral bees among this species, or at least we do not
know of any being yet discovered.</p>

<p>Another species of the solitary bee (apis centuncularis, Linn.)
constructs her nest in pieces of rotten wood, and has therefore
been called the carpenter bee.<a href="#Footnote96" id="FNanchor96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> She divides it into stages, disposing
them sometimes in three rows, with partitions curiously
left between each; in these she deposits her eggs, with the food
necessary for the young ones when hatched. They separate the
wood in a very expeditious manner, by dividing its ligneous fibres
or threads, till they have made a proper sized hole.</p>

<p>The art and sagacity displayed by another bee,<a href="#Footnote97" id="FNanchor97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> whose nest is
constructed of single pieces of leaves, is truly wonderful. The
nest itself is cylindrical, formed of several cells, placed one within<span class="pagenum" id="Page306">[306]</span>
the other, as thimbles are in a hard-ware shop. The cells consist
of several pieces cut from one leaf, of forms and proportions
proper to coincide with the place each is intended to occupy.
The outer case or cover is formed with equal care and exactness.
In a word, says Bonnet, there is so much exactness, symmetry,
uniformity, and skill, in this little master-piece, that we should
not believe it to be the work of a fly, if we did not know at
what school she learnt the art of constructing it. In each cell
the mother deposits an almost liquid substance, and yet so nicely
are the cells formed, as not to suffer any of this substance to be
lost. But for a minute account of the works of this bee, and the
curious mechanism of its cells, we must refer the reader to
Reaumur&#8217;s admirable history of insects.</p>

<p>The proceedings of the mason ichneumon wasp,<a href="#Footnote98" id="FNanchor98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> sphex, Linn.
are totally different from those of the common wasp, though
equally curious. It generally begins its work in May, and continues
it for the greatest part of June. The true object of her
labour seems to be the digging of a hole a few inches deep in the
ground; yet in the constructing of this, she forms a hollow tube
above ground, the base of which is the aperture of the hole, and
which is raised as high above ground as the hole is deep below;
it is formed with a great deal of care, resembling a gross kind of
fillagree work, consisting of the sand drawn from the hole. The
sand out of which she excavates her cell, is nearly as hard as a
common stone; this it readily softens with a penetrating liquor
with which she is well provided; a drop or two of it is imbibed
immediately by the sand on which it falls, which is instantly
rendered so soft, that she can separate and knead it with her
teeth and fore feet, forming it into a small ball, which she places
on the edge of the hole as the foundation stone of the pillar she<span class="pagenum" id="Page307">[307]</span>
is going to erect; the whole of it is formed of such balls, ranged
circularly, and then placed one above the other. She leaves her
work at intervals, probably in order to renew her stock of that
liquor which is so necessary for her operations. These intervals
are of short duration; she soon returns, and labours with so
much activity and ardour, that in a few hours she will dig a
hole two or three inches deep, and raise a hollow pillar two
inches high. After the column has been raised a certain height
perpendicular from the ground, it begins to curve a little, which
curvature increases till it is finished, though the cylindrical form
is maintained: she constructs several of these holes all of the
same form, and for the same purpose. It is easy to see why the
hole was dug in the ground; that it was destined to receive an
egg; but it is not so easy to perceive why the tube of sand was
formed. By attending to the labours of the wasp, one end, however,
may be discovered; it will be found to serve the purpose of
a scaffold, and that the balls are as useful to the wasp, as materials,
&amp;c. to the mason; and are therefore placed as much within
her reach as possible. She uses them to stop and fill up the hole
after she has deposited an egg therein, so that the pillar is then
destroyed, and not the least remains left in the nest. The parent
wasp generally leaves ten or twelve worms as provision necessary
and proper for the growth of the young larva: no purveyor could
take better precautions than our wasp, for she has received her
instructions from HIM who provides for the necessities of all his
creatures. In selecting the worms, she chooses those of a proper
size, that they may be sufficient in quantity, and of an age that
will not be in danger of perishing with hunger, in which case
they would have been corrupted; she therefore selects them when
they have their full growth. It is also observed, that if she
choose a larger sort, she gives a less number of them, and so reciprocally.</p>

<p>From a retrospect view of this chapter, we may observe a
striking difference between man and the lower orders of animal
creation. Man is born totally ignorant; so much so, that he has
no knowledge even of the mother&#8217;s breast, till he has been
brought acquainted with it by repeated trials; he has no innate
ideas, is unable to choose what is proper for his food; he cannot
form his voice to any articulate pronunciation, or to express the
affections of love; whereas the quadruped, the bird, and the insect,
are born to all that knowledge which is necessary for the
gratification of those desires or that love which forms their life;
and, consequently, in the knowledge of every thing relating to
their well-being, their food, their habitations, the commerce of
the sexes, their provision for their young, &amp;c. from the impulse
of the pleasure arising from these innate desires and affections,
the larva is also prompted to seek and aspire after a change of its
earthly state. If it were not foreign to the subject in hand, it
might be easy to shew, by a variety of reasons, that this imperfection
of man at his nativity constitutes his real perfection, and
places him infinitely, if I may so speak, above the brute creation;
for man is not created relatively perfect, but formed a recipient
of all perfection.</p>

<h3>OF THE TERMITES, GENERALLY CALLED WHITE ANTS.</h3>

<p>As no insects exceed the termites in their wonderful &#339;conomy,
wise contrivances, and stupendous buildings, it will be proper to
give the reader some account of them; which I am enabled to do
from the excellent paper written by the late Mr. Smeathman,
and published in the Philosophical Transactions for the year 1781,
part 1.</p>

<p>The termites are represented by Linn&aelig;us as the greatest plagues
of both Indies, and are indeed justly deemed so every where<span class="pagenum" id="Page309">[309]</span>
between the tropics, on account of the vast damages sustained
through them in consequence of their eating and perforating
wooden buildings, utensils, furniture, &amp;c. which are totally destroyed
by them if not timely prevented; for no substance less
hard than metal or stone can escape their most destructive jaws.</p>

<p>These insects have been noticed by various travellers in different
parts of the torrid zone; where numerous, as is the case
with all equinoctial continents, and islands not fully cultivated,
many persons have been excited by curiosity to observe them;
and, indeed, those devoid of that disposition must have been
very fortunate, if, after a short residence, they were not compelled
to pay them attention for the preservation of their property.
They make their approaches chiefly under ground, descending
below the foundations of houses and stores, at several
feet from the surface, and rising again either in the floors, or
entering at the bottoms of the posts of which the sides of the
buildings are composed, boring quite through them, following
the course of the fibres to the top, or making lateral perforations
and cavities here and there as they proceed.</p>

<p>While some are employed in gutting the posts, others ascend
from them, entering a rafter, or some other part of the roof. If
they once find the thatch, which seems to be a favourite food,
they soon bring up wet clay, and build their pipes or galleries
through the roof in various directions, as long as it will support
them; sometimes eating the palm-tree leaves and branches of
which it is composed, and perhaps, for variety seems very pleasing
to them, the rattan, or other running plant, which is used
as a cord to tie the various parts of the roof together, and that to
the posts which support it. Thus, with the assistance of the rats,
who during the rainy season are apt to shelter themselves there,
and to burrow through it, they very soon ruin the house, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page310">[310]</span>
weakening the fastenings, and exposing it to the wet. In the
mean time the posts will be perforated in every direction as full
of holes as that timber in the bottoms of ships, which has been
bored by the worms; the fibrous and knotty parts, which are the
hardest, being left to the last.</p>

<p>These insects are not less expeditious in destroying the shelves,
wainscotting, and other fixtures of an house, than the house itself.
They are continually piercing and boring in all directions, and
sometimes go out of the broadside of one post into that of another
adjoining to it; but they prefer and always destroy the softer
substances the first, and are particularly fond of pine and fir
boards, which they excavate and carry away with wonderful dispatch
and astonishing cunning; for, except a shelf has something
standing upon it, as a book, or any thing else which may tempt
them, they will not perforate the surface, but artfully preserve
it quite whole, and eat away all the inside, except a few fibres
which barely keep the two sides connected together; so that a
piece of an inch-board, which appears solid to the eye, will not
weigh much more than two sheets of pasteboard of equal dimensions,
after these animals have been a little while in possession of
it. In short, the termites are so insidious in their attacks, that
we cannot be too much upon our guard against them: they will
sometimes begin and raise their works, especially in new houses,
through the floor. If you destroy the work so begun, and make
a fire upon the spot, the next night they will attempt to rise
through another part; and if they happen to emerge under a
chest or trunk, early in the night will pierce the bottom, and
destroy or spoil every thing in it before the morning. On these
accounts the inhabitants set all their chests or boxes upon stones
or bricks, so as to leave the bottoms of such furniture some inches
above the ground, which not only prevents these insects finding
them out so readily, but preserves the bottoms from a corrosive<span class="pagenum" id="Page311">[311]</span>
damp, which would strike from the earth through, and rot every
thing therein: a vast deal of vermin also would harbour under,
such as cockroaches, centipedes, millepedes, scorpions, ants, and
various other noisome insects.</p>

<p>It may be presumed that they have obtained the name of ants
from the similarity in their manner of living with those insects,
which is in large communities, that erect very extraordinary
nests, for the most part on the surface of the ground; from
whence their excursions are made through subterraneous passages
or covered galleries, which they build whenever necessity obliges,
or plunder induces them to march above ground, and at a great
distance from their habitations, carry on a business of depredation
and destruction scarce credible but to those who have seen
it; but, notwithstanding they live in communities, and are, like
the ants, omnivorous; though, like them, at a certain period they
are furnished with four wings, and emigrate or colonize at the
same season, they are by no means the same kind of insects, nor
does their form correspond with that of ants in any one state of
their existence.</p>

<p>The termites resemble the ants, indeed, in their provident
and diligent labour, but surpass them, as well as the bees, wasps,
beavers, and all other animals, in the art of building, as much as
Europeans excel the most uncultivated savages. They shew more
substantial instances of ingenuity and industry than any other
animals; and do, in fact, lay up vast magazines of provisions and
other stores; a degree of prudence which has of late years been
denied, perhaps without reason, to the ants.</p>

<p>The communities consist of one male and one female, which
are generally the common parents of the whole or greater part of
the rest, and of three orders of insects, apparently very different<span class="pagenum" id="Page312">[312]</span>
species, but really the same, which together compose great commonwealths
or rather monarchies.</p>

<p>The great Linn&aelig;us having seen or heard of but two of these
orders, has classed the genus erroneously, for he has placed it
among the aptera, or insects without wings; whereas the insect
in its perfect state, having four wings without any sting, belongs
to the neuroptera; in which class it will constitute a new genus
of many species.</p>

<p>The different species of this genus resemble each other in form,
in their manner of living, and in their good and bad qualities,
but differ as much as birds in the manner of building their habitations
or nests, and in the choice of the materials of which they
compose them.</p>

<p>There are some species which build upon the surface of the
ground, or part above and part beneath; and one or two species,
perhaps more, that build on the stem or branches of trees.</p>

<p>There are of every species of termites three orders: 1. The working
insects, which for brevity we shall call labourers. 2. The
fighters or soldiers, which do not labour; and 3. The winged or
perfect insects, which are male and female, and capable of propagation.
From these the kings and queens are chosen, and nature has
so ordered it, that they emigrate within a few weeks after their elevation
to this state, and either establish new kingdoms, or perish
within a day or two. Of these, the working insects or labourers are
always the most numerous; among that species emphatically called
termes bellicosus, which is the largest, there seem to be at the least
one-hundred labourers to one of the fighting insects or soldiers.
They are in this state about one-fourth of an inch long, and
twenty-five of them weigh about a grain, so that they are not so<span class="pagenum" id="Page313">[313]</span>
large as some of our ants; from their external habits and fondness
for wood, they have been very expressively called wood-lice by
some people, and the whole genus has been known by that name,
particularly among the French. They resemble them, it is true,
very much at a distance; they run as fast or faster than any other
insect of their size, and are incessantly in a bustle.</p>

<p>The second order, or soldiers, have a very different appearance
from the labourers, and have been by some authors supposed to
be the males, and the former neuters; but they are, in fact, the
same insects as the foregoing, only they have undergone a change
of form, and approached one degree nearer to the perfect state.
They are much larger, being half an inch long, and equal in size
to fifteen of the labourers. There is now, likewise, a most remarkable
circumstance in the form of the head and mouth; for
in the former state the mouth is evidently calculated for gnawing
and holding bodies; but in this state, the jaws being shaped like
two very sharp awls a little jagged, they are incapable of any
thing but piercing or wounding, for which purposes they are well
calculated, being as hard as a crab&#8217;s claw and placed in a strong
horny head larger than all the rest of the body together.</p>

<p>The insect in its perfect state is varied still more in its form;
the head, thorax, and abdomen, differ almost entirely from the
same parts in the labourers and soldiers; and, besides this, the animal
is now furnished with four fine large brownish transparent
wings, with which it is, at the time of emigration, to wing its
way in search of a new settlement; in short, it differs so much
from its form and appearance in the two other states, that it has
never been supposed to be the same animal, but by those who
have seen it in the same nest; and some of these have distrusted
the evidence of their senses. It was so long before Mr. Smeathman
met with them in the nests, that he doubted the information<span class="pagenum" id="Page314">[314]</span>
which was given him by the natives, that they belonged to
the same family: indeed, twenty nests may be opened without
finding one winged one; for those are to be found only just before
the commencement of the rainy season, when they undergo
the last change, which is preparative to their colonization. Add
to this, they sometimes abandon an outward part of their building,
the community being diminished by some accident that is
unknown; sometimes different species of the real ant, formica,
possess themselves by force of a lodgment, and so are frequently
dislodged from the same nest, and taken for the same kind of
insects. This is often the case with the nests of the smaller species,
which are frequently totally abandoned by the termites, and
completely inhabited by different species of ants, cockroaches,
scolopendr&aelig;, scorpions, and other vermin fond of obscure retreats,
that occupy different parts of their roomy buildings.</p>

<p>In the winged state, their size as well as form is altered.
Their bodies in this state measure between six and seven-tenths
of an inch in length, their wings above two inches and an half
from tip to tip, and they are equal in bulk to about thirty labourers,
or two soldiers. They are furnished with two large eyes
placed on each side of the head; if they had any before, they are
not easily to be distinguished. In this form the animal comes
abroad during or soon after the first tornado, which at the latter
end of the dry season proclaims the approach of the ensuing rains,
and seldom waits for a second or third shower; if the first, as is
generally the case, happen in the night, and bring much wet
after it, the quantities that are to be found the next morning all
over the surface of the earth, but particularly on the waters, is
astonishing; for their wings are only calculated to carry them a
few hours; and after the rising of the sun, not one in a thousand
is to be found with four wings, unless the morning continues
rainy, when here and there a solitary being is seen winging its<span class="pagenum" id="Page315">[315]</span>
way from one place to another, as if solicitous to avoid its numerous
enemies, particularly various species of ants, which are hunting
on every spray, on every leaf, and in every possible place for
this unhappy race, of which probably not one pair in many millions
are preserved to fulfil the first law of nature, and lay the
foundation of a new community. Not only all kinds of ants, and
other insects, but birds, and carnivorous reptiles, are upon the
hunt for them, and the inhabitants of many countries eat them.</p>

<p>From one of the most active, industrious, and rapacious; from
one of the most fierce and implacable little animals in the world,
they are in this state changed into an innocent helpless insect,
incapable of making the least resistance to the smallest ant.
The ants are to be seen on every side in infinite numbers, of various
species and sizes, dragging these annual victims to their
different nests. Some are however so fortunate as to escape, and
be discovered by the labouring insects that are continually running
about the surface of the ground under their covered galleries,
the little industrious creatures immediately inclose them in a small
chamber of clay, suitable to their size, into which at first they
leave but one small entrance, only large enough for themselves
and the soldiers to go in and out, but necessity obliges them to
make more entrances. The voluntary subjects charge themselves
with the task of providing for the offspring of their sovereigns, as
well as to work and to fight for them, until they shall have raised
a progeny capable at least of dividing the task with them.</p>

<p>The business of propagation soon commences; and the labourers
having constructed a small wooden nursery, hereafter
to be described, carry the eggs and lodge them there as fast as
they can obtain them from the queen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page316">[316]</span></p>

<p>About this time a most extraordinary change begins to take
place in the queen, to which we know nothing similar, except in
the pulex penetrans of Linn&aelig;us, the jigger of the West-Indies,
and in the different species of coccus cochineal. The abdomen of
this female begins gradually to extend and enlarge to such an
enormous size, that an old queen will have it increased so as to
be fifteen hundred or two thousand times the bulk of the rest of
her body, and twenty or thirty thousand times the bulk of a labourer;
the skin between the segments of the abdomen extends
in every direction, and at last the segments are removed to half
an inch distance from each other, though at first the length of the
whole abdomen was not above half an inch. They preserve
their dark-brown colour, and the upper part of the abdomen is
marked with a regular series of brown bars, from the thorax to
the posterior part of the abdomen, while the intervals between
them are covered with a thin, delicate, transparent skin, and
appear of a fine cream colour, a little shaded by the dark colour
of the intestines and watery fluid seen here and there beneath.
It is supposed that the animal is upwards of two years old when
the abdomen is increased to three inches in length: they have
sometimes been found of near twice that size. The abdomen is
then of an irregular oblong shape, being contracted by the muscles
of every segment, and is become one vast matrix full of eggs,
which make long circumvolutions through an innumerable quantity
of very minute vessels, that circulate round the inside in a
serpentine manner, which would exercise the ingenuity of a skilful
anatomist to dissect and develope. This singular matrix is
not more remarkable for its amazing extension and size, than for
its peristaltic motion, which resembles the undulation of waves,
and continues incessantly without any apparent effort of the animal;
so that one part or other is alternately rising and sinking in
perpetual succession. The matrix seems never at rest, but to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page317">[317]</span>
always protruding eggs to the amount, in old queens, of sixty in
a minute, or eighty thousand and upwards in one day of twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>These eggs are instantly taken from her body by her attendants,
and carried to the nurseries, which in a great nest may
some of them be four or five feet distant in a straight line, and
consequently much farther by their winding galleries. Here the
young, when they are hatched, are attended and provided with
every thing necessary, until they are able to shift for themselves,
and take their share of the labours of the community.</p>

<p>The termes bellicosus being the largest species, is most remarkable,
and best known on the coast of Africa. It erects
immense buildings of well-tempered clay or earth, which are
contrived and finished with such art and ingenuity, that we are
at a loss to say whether they are most to be admired on that
account, or for their enormous magnitude and solidity. The reason
that the larger termites have been most remarked is obvious;
they not only build larger and more curious nests, but are also
more numerous and do infinitely more mischief to mankind.<a href="#Footnote99" id="FNanchor99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote99"><a href="#FNanchor99" class="label">[99]</a> It may appear
surprizing, that a Being perfectly good should have created animals which
seem to serve no other end but to spread destruction and desolation wherever they go. But let
us be cautious in suspecting any imperfection in the Father of the universe: what, on a superficial
view may seem only productive of mischief, will upon mature deliberation be found worthy
of that wisdom which pervades every part of the creation. Many poisons prove valuable medicines;
storms are beneficial; and diseases often preserve life, and are conducive to its future
enjoyments. The termites, it must be allowed, are frequently pernicious to mankind, but they
are also very useful, and even necessary; one valuable purpose which they serve, is, to destroy
decayed trees and other substances, which, if left on the surface of the ground in hot climates,
would in a short time pollute the air. In this respect, they resemble very much the common
flies, which are regarded by the generality of mankind as noxious, and at best, as useless beings
in the creation; but this is certainly for want of due consideration. There are not probably in
all nature animals of more importance; and it would not be difficult to prove, that we should
feel the want of one or two species of large quadrupeds much less than of one or two species of
these despicable looking insects. Nothing is more disagreeable or more pestiferous than putrid
substances; and it is apparent to all who have made the observation, that these little insects contribute
more to the quick dissolution and dispersion of putrescent matter than any other. They
are so necessary in all hot climates, that even in the open fields a dead animal or small putrid
substance cannot be laid on the ground two minutes, before it will be covered with flies and
their maggots, which instantly entering, quickly devour one part, and, perforating the rest in
various directions, expose the whole to be much sooner dissipated by the elements. Thus it is
with the termites; the rapid vegetation in hot climates, of which no idea can be formed by any
thing to be seen in this, is equalled by as great a degree of destruction from natural as well as
accidental causes. When trees and even woods are in part destroyed by tornados or fire, it is
wonderful to observe how many agents are employed in hastening the total dissolution of the
rest; in this business none are so expert or so expeditious and effectual as the termites, who in a

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page318">[318]</span></p>

<p>The nests of this species are so numerous all over the island of
Bananas, and the adjacent continent of Africa, that it is scarcely
possible to stand upon any open place, such as a rice plantation,
or other clear spot, where one of these buildings is not to be seen
almost close to each other. In some parts near Senegal, as mentioned
by M. Adanson, their number, magnitude, and closeness
of situation, make them appear like the villages of the natives.
These buildings are usually termed hills, by the inhabitants as
well as strangers, from their outward appearance, which is that
of little hills more or less conical, generally very much in the form
of sugar-loaves, and about ten or twelve feet in perpendicular
height above the common surface of the ground.</p>

<p>These hills continue quite bare until they are six or eight feet
high; but, in time, the dead barren clay of which they are composed
becomes fertilized by the genial power of the elements in
these prolific climates, and the addition of vegetable salts and
other matters brought by the wind; and in the second or third
year the hillock, if not overshaded by trees, becomes like the
rest of the earth, almost covered with grass and other plants; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page319">[319]</span>
in the dry season, when the herbage is burnt up by the rays of
the sun, it is not much unlike a very large hay-cock.</p>

<p>Every one of these buildings consists of two distinct parts, the
exterior and interior. The exterior cover is one large clay shell,
in the form of a dome, capacious and strong enough to inclose
and shelter the interior building from the vicissitudes of the weather,
and the inhabitants from the attacks of natural or accidental
enemies. The external cover is always, therefore, much
stronger than the interior building, which is the habitable part,
divided with wonderful regularity and contrivance into an amazing
number of apartments for the residence of the king and
queen, for the nursing of their numerous progeny, and for magazines,
which are always found well filled with stores and provisions.</p>

<p>These hills make their first appearance above ground by a little
turret or two in the shape of sugar-loaves, which are run a foot
high or more; soon after, at some little distance, while the former
are increasing in height and size, they rise others, and so go
on increasing the number, and widening them at the base, till
their works below are covered with these turrets, which the insects
always raise highest and largest towards the middle of the
hill, and by filling up the intervals between each turret, collect
them as it were into one dome. They are not very curious or
exact about these turrets, except in making them very solid and
strong; and when, by the junction of them, the dome is completed,
for which purpose the turrets serve as scaffolds, they take
away the middle ones entirely, except the tops, which joined
together make the crown of the cupola, and apply the clay to the
building of the works within, or to erecting fresh turrets for the
purpose of raising the hillock still higher; so that no doubt some<span class="pagenum" id="Page320">[320]</span>
part of the clay is used several times, like the boards and posts
of a mason&#8217;s scaffold.</p>

<p>The royal chamber, which, on account of its being adapted for,
and occupied by the king and queen, appears to be in the opinion
of this little people, of the most consequence, is always situated
as near the center of the interior building as possible, and
generally about the height of the common surface of the ground,
at a pace or two from the hillock; it is always nearly in the
shape of half an egg or an obtuse oval within, and may be supposed
to represent a long oven. In the infant state of the colony,
it is not above an inch, or thereabouts, in length; but in time
will be increased to six or eight inches or more in the clear, being
always in proportion to the size of the queen, who, increasing in
bulk as in age, at length requires a chamber of such dimensions.
The floor is horizontal, sometimes an inch thick and upward of
solid clay; the roof also, which is one solid and well-turned oval
arch, is generally of about the same solidity, but in some places
it is not a quarter of an inch thick; this is on the sides where it
joins the floor, and where the doors or entrances are made.
These entrances will not admit any animal larger than the soldiers
or labourers; so that the king, and the queen, who is when
full grown a thousand times the weight of a king, can never possibly
go out. The royal chamber, if in a large hillock, is surrounded
by an innumerable quantity of others, of different sizes,
shapes, and dimensions; but all of them arched, sometimes of a
circular, sometimes of an elliptical form. These chambers either
open into each other, or have communicating passages, and being
always empty, are evidently made for the soldiers and attendants;
of whom, it will soon appear, great numbers are necessary, and
of course always in waiting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page321">[321]</span></p>

<p>These apartments are joined by the magazines and nurseries;
the former are chambers of clay, and are always well filled with
provisions, which to the naked eye seem to consist of the raspings
of wood and plants, which the termites destroy, but are found by
the microscope to be chiefly composed of the gums or inspissated
juices of plants, thrown together in little masses, some of which
are finer than others, and resemble the sugar about preserved
fruits; others are like drops of gum. The magazines are intermixed
with the nurseries, buildings totally different from the
rest of the apartments, being composed entirely of wooden materials,
seemingly joined together with gums. They are called
nurseries because they are invariably occupied by the eggs and
young ones, which appear at first in the shape of labourers, but
as white as snow. These buildings are exceedingly compact, and
divided into many very small irregular-shaped chambers, placed
all round the royal apartments, and as near as possible to them.</p>

<p>When the nest is in the infant state, the nurseries are close to the
royal chamber; but as in process of time the queen increases in
size, it is necessary to enlarge the chamber for her accommodation;
and as she then lays a greater number of eggs, and requires a
more numerous train of attendants, so it is necessary to enlarge
and increase the number of the adjacent apartments; for which
purpose, the small nurseries which are first built, are taken to
pieces, rebuilt a little further off, a size larger, and the number of
them increased at the same time. Thus they continually enlarge
their apartments, pull down, repair, or rebuild, according to their
wants, with a degree of sagacity, regularity, and foresight, not
even imitated by any other kind of animals or insects. The nurseries
are inclosed in chambers of clay, like those which contain
the provisions, but much more extensive. In the early state of
the nest they are not larger than an hazel nut, but in great hills
are often as large as a child&#8217;s head of a year old.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page322">[322]</span></p>

<p>The royal chamber is situated nearly on a level with the surface
of the ground, at an equal distance from all the sides of the
building, and directly under the apex of the hill. It is, on all
sides, both above and below, surrounded by what may be called
the royal apartments, which have only labourers and soldiers in
them, and can be intended for no other purpose than for these to
wait in, either to guard or serve their common father and mother,
on whose safety depends the happiness, and, according to the
account of the negroes, even the existence of the whole community.</p>

<p>These apartments form an intricate labyrinth, which extends
a foot or more in diameter from the royal chamber on every side.
Here the nurseries and magazines of provisions begin, and being
separated by small empty chambers and galleries, which go round
them, or communicate from one to the other, are continued on
all sides to the outward shell, and reach up within it two-thirds
or three-fourths of its height, having an open area in the middle
under the dome, resembling the nave of an old cathedral. This
area is surrounded by large gothic arches, which are sometimes
two or three feet high next the front of the area, but diminish
very rapidly as they recede from thence, like the arches of aisles
in perspective, and are soon lost among the innumerable chambers
and nurseries behind them. All these chambers, and the
passages leading to and from them, being arched, contribute to
support one another; and while the interior large arches prevent
their falling into the center, and keep the area open, the exterior
building supports them on the outside.</p>

<p>The interior building, or assemblage of nurseries, chambers, &amp;c.
has a flattish top or roof without any perforation; by this contrivance,
if any water should penetrate the external dome, the
apartments below are preserved from injury. It is never exactly<span class="pagenum" id="Page323">[323]</span>
flat and uniform, because they are always adding to it by building
more chambers and nurseries: so that the divisions or columns
between the future arched apartments resemble the pinnacles
upon the fronts of some old buildings, and demand particular
notice, as affording one proof that for the most part the insects
project their arches, and do not make them by excavation. The
area is likewise water-proof, and contrived so as to let the water
off, if it should get in and run over, by some short way, into
the subterraneous passages, which run under the lowest apartments
in the hill in various directions, and are of an astonishing
size, being wider than the bore of a great cannon. There is an
account of one that was measured, which was perfectly cylindrical,
and thirteen inches in diameter.</p>

<p>These subterraneous passages or galleries are lined very thick
with the same kind of clay of which the hill is composed, and
ascend the inside of the outward shell in a spiral manner; winding
round the whole building up to the top, they intersect each
other at different heights, opening either immediately into the
dome in various places, and into the interior building, the new
turrets, &amp;c. or communicating thereto by other galleries of different
bores or diameters, either circular or oval.</p>

<p>From every part of these large galleries are various small pipes
or galleries, leading to different parts of the building; under
ground there are a great many which lead downward, by sloping
descents three and four feet perpendicular among the gravel, from
whence the labouring termites cull the finer parts, which being
worked up in their mouths to the consistence of mortar, becomes
that solid clay or stone, of which their hills and all their buildings,
except the nurseries, are composed. Other galleries again
ascend and lead out horizontally on every side, and are carried
under ground near to the surface, a vast distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page324">[324]</span></p>

<p>There is a kind of necessity for the galleries under the hills
being thus large, as they are the great thoroughfares for all the
labourers and soldiers going forth or returning upon any business
whatever, whether fetching clay, wood, water, or provisions; and
they are certainly well calculated for the purposes to which they
are applied, by the spiral slope which is given them.</p>

<p>Those species which build either the roofed turrets, or the
nests in the trees, seem in most instances to have a strong resemblance
to the preceding, both in their form and &#339;conomy, going
through the same changes from the egg to the winged state.
The queens also increase to a great size when compared with the
labourers, but very short of those queens before described. The
largest are from about an inch to an inch and an half long, and
not much thicker than a common quill. There is the same kind
of peristaltic motion in the abdomen, but in a much smaller degree;
and as the animal is incapable of moving from her place,
the eggs, no doubt are carried to the different cells by the labourers,
and reared with a care similar to that which is practised
in the larger nests.</p>

<p>It is remarkable of all these different species, that the working
and the fighting insects never expose themselves to the open air,
but either travel under ground, or within such trees and substances
as they destroy; except, indeed, when they cannot proceed
by their latent passages, and find it convenient or necessary
to search for plunder above ground: in that case they make pipes
of that material with which they build their nests. The larger
sort use the red clay; the turret builders use the black clay; and
those which build in the trees employ the same ligneous substance
of which their nests are composed.</p>

<p>The termites, except their heads, are exceedingly soft, and covered
with a very thin and delicate skin; being blind, they are no<span class="pagenum" id="Page325">[325]</span>
match on open ground for the ants, who can see, and are all of
them covered with a strong horny shell not easily pierced, and are
of dispositions bold, active, and rapacious.</p>

<p>Whenever the termites are dislodged from their covered ways,
the various species of formic&aelig; or ants, who probably are as numerous
above ground, as the latter are in their subterraneous passages,
instantly seize and drag them away to their nests, to feed
the young brood. The termites are, therefore, exceedingly solicitous
about the preserving their covered ways in good repair;
and if you demolish one of them for a few inches in length, it is
wonderful how soon they re-build it. At first in their hurry they
get into the open part an inch or two, but stop so suddenly, that
it is very apparent they are surprized; for, though some run
straight on, and get under the arch as speedily as possible in the
further part, most of them run as fast back, and very few will
venture through that part of the track which is left uncovered.
In a few minutes you will perceive them re-building the arch,
and by the next morning they will have restored their gallery for
three or four yards in length, if so much has been ruined; and
upon opening it again, will be found as numerous as ever under
it, passing both ways. If you continue to destroy it several
times, they will at length seem to give up the point, and build
another in a different direction; but, if the old one should lead
to some favourite plunder, in a few days will re-build it again,
and, unless you destroy their nest, never totally abandon their,
gallery.</p>

<h3>OF THE HABITATIONS OF CATERPILLARS.</h3>

<p>Though the view which has already been given of the various
proceedings of insects in forming their habitations, has extended
to some length, I cannot with propriety omit noticing the wonderful<span class="pagenum" id="Page326">[326]</span>
art and industry which is manifested in these respects by
the caterpillar; and more particularly so, as from the larva state
the foundation of all our present knowledge of the natural history
of insects has been obtained.</p>

<p>Some species of caterpillars form a kind of hammock, in which
they eat and go through their various changes; while others erect
a silken tent, under which they live until they have consumed the
surrounding herbs. They then leave their abodes, and pitch their
tents in a more fruitful spot.</p>

<p>Many associate together all their lives; these proceed from the
same moth, who deposited her eggs near each other, or rather
laid them in a heap, forming as it were a kind of nest. They
are generally hatched on the same day, and, living together, constitute
a new species of republic, in which all are brethren. They
often amount to near six hundred in a family, though they are
frequently to be found with only about two hundred. Of these
social caterpillars there are some species which not only continue
with the society while they are in a larva state, but even place
their pup&aelig; close together. There are other kinds who associate
only for a short period.</p>

<p>Among the vast variety of insects which inhabit the oak, there
is a species of caterpillar which live separate till they arrive at a
certain age; they then assemble together, and do not quit each
other till they attain their perfect state. As the number thus
assembled is considerable, the nest is also very large. They remain
in-doors during the day, not leaving their habitation till
sun-set. When they go out, one of the body precedes the rest as
a chief, whom they regularly follow; when the leader stops, the
rest do the same, and wait till it goes on again, before they recommence
their march. The first file generally consists of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page327">[327]</span>
single caterpillar, which is succeeded by a double file; these, by
three in a row, which are then followed by files of five, and so
on. They keep exceeding close to each other, not leaving any
interval either between the ranks, or those in each rank; all of
them following their captain in every direction, whether straight
or crooked. After they have taken their repast, which is done
on the march, they return to their nest in the same order in which
they set out.</p>

<p>This mode is followed till they are full grown, when each
forms a cone, in which it is changed into a chrysalis. M. Bonnet
has shewn, that though these caterpillars proceed often very far
from their nest, it is by no means difficult for them to get back
again, because they spin over all the places in their rout. The
first leads the way, the second follows spinning, the third spins
after the first and second, and so on with the rest. All these
threads form by degrees a small shining track, a little path; and
all these paths meet at the nest. To be fully convinced of the
use of these threads, let any one but break the continuation of
them in some particular part, and he will see the little caterpillars
turn back, as if they were at a loss, till one more daring than the
rest restores the communication by spinning new threads.</p>

<p>The reader who is desirous of a fuller information concerning
the habits of these, as well as many other insects, must be referred
to the laborious and interesting memoirs of Reaumur. Happy if
he should, like De Geer, be induced thereby to follow the steps of
so great a master; he will derive from thence a continual source
of new pleasures and increasing delights; and the more he extends
the boundaries of his observations, the more he will be convinced
that <span class="smcapall">INFINITY</span> is, as it were, impressed on all the works of the
<span class="smcap">Creator</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page328">[328]</span></p>

<p>Different species of caterpillars are often to be found in great
numbers on the same tree or plant; but then as they seem to
have no connection with each other, and the actions of the one
have no influence on the rest, they may be considered as solitary;
but there are others who seem still more independent of
each other, and greater friends to solitude, constructing a lodging
formed of leaves tied together with considerable ingenuity,
in which they live as in a hermitage. The operation by which
these tie the leaves together, is far surpassed by another kind,
who fold and bend one part of the leaf till it meets the other.
These are again exceeded by those who roll the leaves which
they inhabit. For this purpose the caterpillar chooses a part of a
leaf which it finds in some degree bent; here it establishes its
abode, and begins its work, moving the head with great velocity
in a curved line, or rather vibrating it like a pendulum, the middle
of the body being the center on which it moves. At each
motion of the head a thread is spun, and fixed to that part to
which the head seems to be applied. The threads are extended
from the bent to the flat part of the leaf, being always adjusted
both in length and strength to the nature of the leaf, and the curvature
which is to be given to it.</p>

<p>De Geer attending to the operations of a species of this kind
of caterpillar, observed that at each new thread it spun, the edges
of the leaf insensibly approached to each other, and were bent
more and more, in proportion as the caterpillar spun new threads;
when the last thread that was spun was tight, that which preceded
it was loose and floating in the air. To effect this, the
caterpillar, after it has fixed a thread to the two edges of the leaf,
and before it spins another, draws it towards itself by the hooks
of its feet, and by these means bends the leaf; it then spins another
thread, to maintain the leaf in this position, which it again pulls<span class="pagenum" id="Page329">[329]</span>
towards itself, and repeats the operation, till it has bent the leaf
in its whole direction. It now begins again, placing the threads
further back upon the bent part of the leaf, and by proceeding in
this manner, it is rolled up; when it has finished this business, it
strengthens the work, by fastening the ends of the leaf together.
The habitation thus formed is a kind of hollow cylinder, open to
the light at both ends, the sides of it affording the insect food and
protection, for within it the creature feeds in safety. In the same
case they are also transformed; at the approach of the change the
caterpillar lines the rolled leaf with silk, that the rough parts of it
may not injure the chrysalis.</p>

<p>A great number of the smaller larv&aelig; require an artificial covering,
to protect them from the open air. Among these, some inhabit
the interior parts of leaves, making their way between the
superior and inferior membranes, living upon the parenchymous
parts of the leaf; and as they are exceedingly small, a leaf affords
them a spacious habitation. If the distance between the membranes
be not large enough for them, they enlarge the space by
forming different folds in one of them, in which they can move
with ease: from these circumstances they have been named by
Reaumur miners of leaves. This illustrious author has described
these larv&aelig;, the flies into which they are changed, and all the
Various methods made use of by them in performing this work.
Some mine a large oval or circular space; others form a kind of
gallery, which is sometimes straight, sometimes crooked. They
only leave a thin membrane on the upper side of the leaf; but
they leave the under side more substantial. One species of moth
which proceeds from these larv&aelig; is very small but exceedingly
beautiful.</p>

<p>The larv&aelig; of the phryganea mostly live in little cases of their
own building, which are formed of a variety of materials, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page330">[330]</span>
they train after them in the water wherever they go. These
cases are generally cylindrical, and open at both ends; the inside
is lined with silk spun by the larva, the outside formed of different
substances, as bits of reed, stone, gravel, and some entirely of
small shells, &amp;c. which they arrange and manage with singular
dexterity: they never quit this case. When they walk, they put
out the head, and a few of the first rings of the body, training
the case after them.</p>

<p>Having lived in the water for some time, they become inhabitants
of the air. They assume the pupa form in the water, closing
up the two ends of the case with bars of silk, by which it is secured
from the attacks of its enemies; and at the same time there
is a free passage for the water, which is still necessary for its existence.
At a proper period the pupa forces its way through the
case, and makes for the land, where its further change instantly
commences, and is soon completed.</p>

<p>We shall close these specimens of the industry of insects with
an account of that which is displayed by the larv&aelig; of the tine&aelig;.
The greatest part of the body of these little creatures, except
the head and six fore feet, is covered over with a thin tender
skin; the body of the insect is cylindrical, and lodged in a tube
which is open at both ends. Soon after they are born, they begin
to cover themselves, and are, therefore, seldom to be found
but in these tubes or cases. They are in general so small, that it
is not easy to distinguish the cases without a magnifier; but as
the body lengthens, the case becomes too short; it is, therefore,
part of its daily employ to lengthen it. For this purpose it extends
the head beyond the tube, and having found the materials
which answer its purpose, it tears it off, and brings it to the end
of the tube, and fixes it there, repeating this manoeuvre till it
has sufficiently lengthened it. After it has finished one end, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page331">[331]</span>
turns itself round within the case, and performs the same operation
at the other.</p>

<p>This does not terminate their labours, for the tube must also be
increased in diameter, as it soon becomes too small for the body;
the means they make use of to enlarge it, is precisely the same as
we ourselves should adopt under similar circumstances. The
insect slits the tube at the two opposite sides, at the same end,
and inserts in the slit two pieces of the required size; it then performs
the same at the other end. By these means they soon
enlarge it sufficiently, without exposing themselves to the air
during the operation. The outside of these cases is made of silk,
hair, &amp;c. the inside is of silk only. Their covering always partakes
of the colour of the cloth or tree, &amp;c. from whence it was
taken; if it pass over a red piece, the colour will be red. When
they are come to their perfect growth, they abandon the cloth,
and seek for a proper place wherein they may pass from their
present to a more perfect state.</p>

<p>I cannot conclude this long chapter better than in the words
of Mr. Stillingfleet. &#8220;Many are apt to treat with contempt any
man whom they see employed in poring over a moss, or examining
an insect, from day to day, thinking that he spends his
time and his life in unimportant and barren speculations; yet
were the whole scene of nature laid open to our views, were we
admitted to behold the connections and dependences of every
thing on every other, and to trace the &#339;conomy of nature through
the smaller, as well as greater parts of this globe, we might,
perhaps, be obliged to own that we were mistaken; that the
Supreme Architect had contrived his works in such a manner,
that we cannot properly be said to be unconcerned in any one of
them; and, therefore, that studies, which seem upon a slight
view to be quite useless, may in the end appear of no small importance<span class="pagenum" id="Page332">[332]</span>
to mankind. Nay, were we only to look back into the
history of arts and sciences, we must be convinced that we are
apt to judge over hastily of things of this nature. We should
there find many proofs that he who gave this instinctive curiosity
to some of his creatures, gave it for good and great purposes, and
that he rewards with useful discoveries all these minute researches.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true, this does not always happen to the searcher, or his
contemporaries, nor even sometimes to the immediate succeeding
generation; but I am apt to think, that advantages of one kind or
other always accrue to mankind from such pursuits; some men
are born to observe and record what perhaps by itself is perfectly
useless, but yet of great importance to another who follows and
goes a step further, still as useless; to him another succeeds, and
thus by degrees, till at last one of a superior genius comes, who
laying all that has been done before this time together, brings on
a new face of things, improves, adorns, exalts human society.</p>

<p>&#8220;All those speculations concerning lines and numbers, so ardently
pursued, and so exquisitely conducted by the Grecians,
what did they aim at? or what did they produce for ages? a little
arithmetic, and the first elements of geometry, were all they had
need of. This Plato asserts; and though, as being himself an able
mathematician, and remarkably fond of these sciences, he recommends
the study of them; yet he makes use of motives that have
no relation to the common purposes of life.</p>

<p>&#8220;When Kepler, from a blind and strong impulse, merely to
find analogies in nature, discovered that famous one between the
distance of the several planets from the sun, and the periods in
which they complete their revolutions, of what importance was it
to him or the world?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page333">[333]</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Again; when Galileo, pushed on by the same irresistible curiosity,
found out the law by which bodies fall to the earth, did
he, or could he foresee that any good would come from his ingenious
theorems; or was any immediate use made of them?</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet had not the Greeks pushed their abstract speculations so
far, had not Kepler and Galileo made the above-mentioned discoveries,
we never could have seen the greatest work that ever came
from the hands of man, Sir Isaac Newton&#8217;s Principia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some obscure person, whose name is not so much as known,
diverting himself idly, as a stander-by would have thought, with
trying experiments on a seemingly contemptible piece of stone,
found out a guide for mariners on the ocean, and such a guide as
no science, however subtil and sublime its speculations may be,
however wonderful its conclusions, would ever have arrived at.
It was mere curiosity that put Sir Thomas Millington upon examining
the minute parts of flowers; but his discoveries have produced
the most perfect and most useful system of botany that the
world has yet seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Other instances might be produced to prove, that bare curiosity
in one age, is the source of the greatest utility in another;
and what has frequently been said of chemists, may be applied to
every other kind of vertuosi. They hunt, perhaps, after chimeras
and impossibilities; they find something really valuable by the bye.
We are but instruments under the Supreme Director, and do not
so much as know, in many cases, what is of most importance for
us to search after; but we may be sure of one thing, viz. that if
we study and follow nature, whatever paths we are led into, we
shall at last arrive at something valuable to ourselves and others,
but of what kind we must be content to remain ignorant.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class="chapno">CHAP. VI.</span><br />
<span class="chapname">A GENERAL VIEW OF THE INTERNAL PARTS OF INSECTS, AND
MORE PARTICULARLY OF THE CATERPILLAR OF THE PHAL&AElig;NA
COSSUS&mdash;-A DESCRIPTION OF SUNDRY MISCELLANEOUS
OBJECTS.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="startcapital">T</span>he interior part of insects includes four principal viscera; the
spinal marrow, the intestinal bag, the heart, and tracheal vessels.</p>

<p>The spinal marrow, or principal trunk of the nerves of insects,
is a whitish thread, extended the whole length from the head to
the hindermost part, furnished at intervals with small knots or
ganglions. From these knots proceed the nervous threads that
are supposed to be the instruments of sensation and motion.</p>

<p>On the medullary thread is placed the intestinal bag, which is
equal to it in length; it is a long gut, in which are contained the
oesophagus, the stomach, and intestines.</p>

<p>Along the back, and parallel to the intestinal bag, runs a long
thin vessel, in which may be perceived through the skin of the
insect alternate contractions and dilatations; this part is supposed
to perform the functions of the heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page335">[335]</span></p>

<p>The tracheal vessels of insects are very similar to those of
plants; are of the same structure, colour, and elasticity, and are,
like them, dispersed through the whole body.</p>

<p>A clearer idea of these parts will be obtained by the short extract
I shall give of M. Lyonet&#8217;s work; which, at the same time that it
displays the wonderful organization of insects, shews how worthy
it is of the attention of a rational being; and, though this description
is confined to a particular species, it will be found to accord
in general with a great number.</p>

<p>Of all the modifications of which matter is susceptible, the most
noble is undoubtedly the organization thereof. In the structure of
animals, the Sovereign Wisdom is exhibited to our view in the
most striking manner. The body of an animal is a little particular
system more or less complicated, and which, like the system
of the universe at large, is the result of the combination and connection
of a multitude of different parts, which all conspire to
produce one general effect, the manifestation of the principle
which we term life. So wonderful are these combinations that
we are incapable of comprehending, or even of admiring sufficiently
the astonishing apparatus of springs, levers, counter-weights,
tubes of different diameters, &amp;c. which constitute these organical
machines. The interior parts of the insect, the most despicable
in appearance, would absorb all the powers of the most able
anatomist. He would be lost in the labyrinth as soon as he attempted
to explore all its windings. A truth that will be evident
to every one who considers only the small portion here introduced
of the anatomy of the caterpillar inhabiting the trunk of the
willow-tree. This caterpillar produces the phal&aelig;na cossus, or
goat-moth. M. Lyonet in his admirable work entitled, &#8220;Traite
Anatomique de la Chenille qui ronge le Bois de Saule,&#8221; has given
an ample and minute description of this insect. In the following<span class="pagenum" id="Page336">[336]</span>
concise abstract enough will appear to convince the reader of the
utility of microscopic glasses, in displaying the wonders of the
creation, and to afford additional proof that the attention of the
Almighty is not confined merely to objects of magnitude.</p>

<p>In a former edition of this work, I entered into a more minute
detail of the several parts contained in the figures exhibited
in <a href="#Plate12">plate XII</a>. This account I have now omitted, as after all
it could not convey a clear idea of the muscles alone, much less
of the different parts of the caterpillar, without a reference to
other plates of M. Lyonet&#8217;s work. I therefore concluded it would
be better to let the figures speak for themselves, and then give a
general description of the interior parts of the caterpillar; referring
the reader for full particulars to the original.</p>

<p>Figures 1 and 2 represent the muscles of the caterpillar, when
it is opened at the belly. Fig. 3 and 4 exhibit a view of the
muscles when it is opened at the back. Fig. 5 and 6, an anatomical
delineation of the head; so complex is this organ, that in
order to give an adequate idea of its structure, M. Lyonet has
employed no less than twenty figures. Fig. 7 is an out-line of
the head more magnified than in the last figures. In order to
obtain the views here exhibited, the muscles were freed as well
from fat, as from the nerves and other vessels.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcapall">BODY</span> of the caterpillar in the <a href="#Plate12">Plate</a> Fig. 2 and 3, is divided
into twelve parts, corresponding to its rings marked by the
numbers 1 to 12; to the first number the word <span class="smcapall">RING</span> is affixed.
Each of these rings is distinguished from that which follows, and
that preceding it, by a kind of neck or small hollow part. By
conceiving a line to pass through these necks, and forming boundaries
to the rings, we acquire twelve more divisions, Fig. 1
and 4; these are also marked with the numbers 1 to 12; to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page337">[337]</span>
first the word <span class="smcapall">DIVISION</span> is annexed. The several parts exhibited
in the divisions, Fig. 1, are the muscles; those in Fig. 2, under
the word ring, are also muscles, which appear when those in
Fig. 1 are removed, lying under them.</p>

<p>The anatomical delineation of the muscles of the head, Fig. 5
and 6, should be considered as consisting of two figures, which
join in the middle, being terminated by the superior and inferior
lines. The head, as here represented, is magnified about three-hundred
times. <span class="smcapall">H H</span> are the two palpi: the truncated muscles d,
belong to the lower lip, and form a part of those which give it
motion: <span class="smcapall">K</span>, the two ganglions of the neck united: <span class="smcapall">I I</span>, the two
silk vessels: <span class="smcapall">L</span>, the oesophagus: <span class="smcapall">M</span>, the two dissolving vessels: the
Hebrew letters denote the continuation of the cephalic arteries:
<span class="smcapall">S T U W</span> and <span class="smcapall">X</span> are the ten abductor muscles of the jaw: under e e
and f f are seen four occipital muscles: a a, a nerve of the first
pair, belonging to the ganglion of the neck; b, a branch of this
nerve.</p>

<p>Fig. 7 is an outline of the head magnified considerably more than
in the last figure, exhibiting the nerves as seen from the under part.
Excepting in two or three instances, only one nerve of each
pair is shewn, as a greater number would have occasioned confusion.
The nerves of the first ganglion of the neck are designed
by capital letters; those of the ganglion a, are distinguished by
Roman letters; those of the small ganglion, by Greek characters;
and those of the frontal ganglion, except one, by numbers.</p>

<h3>A GENERAL VIEW OF THE INTERIOR PARTS OF THE
CATERPILLAR.</h3>

<p>The <span class="smcapall">MUSCLES</span> have neither the exterior form, nor the colour
of those of larger animals. In their natural state they are soft,<span class="pagenum" id="Page338">[338]</span>
and have the appearance of a jelly; they are of a greyish blue,
and the silver-coloured appearance of the aerial or pulmonary vessels,
which creep over and penetrate their substance, exhibits
under the microscope a most beautiful spectacle. When the
caterpillar has been soaked for some time in spirit of wine, they
lose their elasticity and transparency, and become firm, opake,
and white; the aerial vessels disappear. At first sight they might
be taken for tendons, as they are of the same colour and possess
almost the same lustre. They are generally flat, and of an equal
size throughout; the middle seldom differs either in colour, substance,
or size, from the extremities. The ends are fixed to the
skin; the rest of the muscle is generally free and floating; several
of them branch out considerably; the branches extend sometimes
so far, that it is not always easy to discover whether they are distinct
and separate muscles, or parts of another. They are of a
moderate strength; those that have been soaked in spirit of wine,
when examined by the microscope, will be found to be covered
with a membrane which may be separated from them; they then
appear to consist of several parallel bands, disposed according to
the length of the muscle. These, when divided by the assistance
of very fine needles, appear to be composed of still smaller
bundles of fibres, in the same direction; which, when examined
by a very deep magnifier, and in a favourable light, appear twisted
like a small cord. The muscular fibres of the spider, which are
much larger than those of the caterpillar, are found on examination
to consist of two substances, one soft, and the other hard;
the last is twisted round the former spirally, and thus gives to it
the afore-mentioned cord-like appearance. If the muscles are
separated by means of very fine needles, in a drop of some fluid,
we find that they are not only composed of fibres, membranes,
and aerial vessels, but also of nerves; and, from the drops of oil
that may be seen floating on the fluid, that they are also furnished
with many unctuous particles. The muscles in a caterpillar<span class="pagenum" id="Page339">[339]</span>
are very numerous, exceeding by much those of the human
body; the reader may form some idea of their number by inspecting
Fig. 1 2 3 and 4 of <a href="#Plate12">Plate XII.</a> They occupy the greatest
part of the head; there is an amazing number at the oesophagus,
the intestines, &amp;c. the skin is as it were lined by different beds
of them, placed one under the other, and ranged with very great
symmetry. The number of muscles that our observer has been
able to distinguish is truly astonishing; he found 228 in the head,
1647 in the body, and 2066 in the intestinal tube, making in all
3941!</p>

<p>The <span class="smcapall">SPINAL MARROW</span>, and the brain of the caterpillar, if it
can be said to have any, seem to have very little relation to those
of man; in the last, the brain is inclosed in a bony cavity; it occupies
the greatest part of the head, and is anfractuose, and divided
into lobes. There is nothing similar to this in the caterpillar;
we find indeed in the head of that which we are describing,
a part which seems to answer the purpose of the brain, because
the nerves that are disseminated through the head are
derived from it; but then this part is unprotected, and so small,
that it does not occupy one-fifth part of the head; the surface is
smooth, and has neither lobes nor anfractuousness; and if we
must call this a brain, the caterpillar may be said to have thirteen,
as there are twelve more such parts following each other in a
line; they are nearly of the same size with that in the head, and
of the same substance, and it is from them that the nerves are
distributed through the whole body. Lest the idea of thirteen
brains might be disagreeable to his readers, Lyonet has called
these parts ganglions. The spinal marrow in the human species
descends down the back, inclosed in a bony case; is large with
respect to its length, and not divided into branches, diminishing
in thickness in proportion as it is removed further from the brain.
In the caterpillar, the spinal marrow goes along the belly, is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page340">[340]</span>
inclosed in any tube, is very small, forks out at intervals, and is
nearly of the same thickness throughout, except at the ganglions.
For a description of the numerous vessels, and curious texture of
these parts, reference must be had to the original work of Lyonet.
The substance of the spinal marrow, and of the ganglions, is not
near so tender and easily separated as in man; it has a very great
degree of tenacity, and does not break without considerable tension.
The substance of the ganglions differs from that of the spinal marrow,
as no vessels can be discovered in the latter, whereas the former
are full of very delicate ones. The patient anatomist of the caterpillar
has counted forty-five pair of nerves, and two single ones;
so that there are ninety-two principal nerves, whose ramifications
are innumerable.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcapall">TRACHEAL ARTERIES</span> of the caterpillar are two large aerial
elastic vessels, which with their numerous ramifications may be
pressed close together, and drawn out considerably, but return
immediately to their usual size when the tension ceases; they
creep under the skin close to the spiracula, one at the right side
of the insect, the other at the left, each of them communicating
with the air, by means of nine spiracula; they are nearly as long
as the body, beginning at the first spiraculum, and going a little
farther than the last, terminating in some branches which extend
to the extremities of the body. Round about each spiraculum the
tracheal artery pushes forth a great number of branches, which
are again divided into smaller ones; these further subdivide, and
spread through the whole body of the caterpillar. This vessel
and its principal branches are composed of three coats, which
may be separated one from the other. The exterior covering is
a thick membrane, furnished with a great number of fibres, which
describe a vast variety of circles round it, communicating with
each other by numerous shoots. The second is very thin and
transparent; no particular vessel is distinguished in it. The third<span class="pagenum" id="Page341">[341]</span>
is composed of scaly threads, which are generally turned in a
spiral form, and come so near each other, as scarce to leave any
interval; these threads are curiously united with the membrane
which occupies the intervals, and form a tube which is always
open, notwithstanding the flexure of the vessel. There are also
many other peculiarities in its structure, which cannot be well
explained without more plates. The principal tracheal vessels
branch out into 236 smaller ones, from which there spring 1326
different ramifications.</p>

<p>The part of the caterpillar which naturalists call the <span class="smcapall">HEART</span>,
without being certain that it performs the functions thereof, is
of a nature very different from that of larger animals. It is almost
as long as the caterpillar itself, lies immediately under the skin at
the top of the back, entering into the head, and terminating near
the mouth. It is large and spacious towards the last rings of the
body, and diminishes very much as it approaches the head, from
the fourth to the twelfth division; it has on both sides, at each
division, an appendage, which partly covers the muscles of the
back; but, growing narrower as it approaches the lateral line,
forms a number of irregular lozenge-shaped bodies. This muscular
tube has been called the heart of the caterpillar; first, because
it is generally filled with a kind of lymph, which has been
supposed to be the blood of the caterpillar; secondly, because in
all caterpillars, whose skin is in some degree transparent, continual,
regular, and alternate dilatations and contractions may be
perceived along the superior line, beginning at the eleventh ring,
and going on from ring to ring to the fourth, whence this vessel
has been considered as a file of hearts; but still this viscera seems
to have very little relation to the heart of larger animals; we find
no vessel opening into it, to answer to the aorta, vena cava,
&amp;c. &amp;c. Near the eighth division are two white oblong masses,<span class="pagenum" id="Page342">[342]</span>
that join the tube of the heart; they have been called reniform
bodies, because they are something similar to a kidney in their
shape.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcapall">CORPUS CRASSUM</span> is, with respect to volume, the most
considerable part of the whole caterpillar; it is the first and only
substance that is seen on opening it, forming a kind of sheath,
which envelopes and covers all the entrails, and introducing itself
into the head, enters all the muscles of the body, filling the
greatest part of the empty spaces in the caterpillar. It is of a
milk-white colour. In its configuration it is very similar to the
human brain. When the different masses of the corpus crassum
which covers the entrails are removed, the largest parts are the
oesophagus, the ventricle, and the large intestines.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcapall">OESOPHAGUS</span> descends from the bottom of the mouth to
about the fourth division. The anterior part which is in the
head is fleshy, narrow, and fixed by different muscles to the crustaceous
parts thereof; the lower part which passes into the body
is wider, and forms a kind of membranaceous bag, which is covered
with very small muscles; near the stomach it is again narrower,
and is as it were bridled by a strong nerve, which is fixed
to it at distant intervals.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcapall">VENTRICLE</span> begins a little above the fourth division,
where the oesophagus finishes, and terminates at the tenth division;
it is about seven times longer than it is broad; the anterior
part, which is the broadest, is generally folded. The folds diminish
with the bulk, in proportion as it approaches the intestines.
An assemblage of nerves cover the surface, it is surrounded
by a number of aerial vessels, and opens into a tube,
which Lyonet calls the large intestine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page343">[343]</span></p>

<p>There are three of these large tubes or <span class="smcapall">INTESTINES</span>, each of
which differs from the other so much, both in structure and character
as to require a particular name to distinguish them; though
this is not the place to enumerate these characteristic differences.
As most caterpillars are endued with a power or faculty of
spinning, they are provided with two vessels where the substance
is prepared, which, when drawn out, and extended in the air,
becomes a silken thread; these two vessels are termed the silk-vessels
or tubes; in the caterpillar of the cossus, they are often
above three inches long, and are distinguished into three parts,
the anterior, the intermediate, and posterior. It has also two
other vessels, which are supposed to prepare and contain the liquor
by which it dissolves the wood on which it feeds.</p>

<p>Thus have we endeavoured to give the reader some idea of
the wonderful organization of this apparently imperfect animal.
Assuredly the four-thousand<a href="#Footnote100" id="FNanchor100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> muscles employed in the construction
of the caterpillar of the cossus cannot be considered without
the deepest astonishment: their admirable co-ordination and
junction with other parts equally numerous, yet all harmonizing
and acting together as if they were essentially one, naturally lead
the mind to consider the nature and perfection of creation, and
to perceive that it is an exhibition of the highest wisdom; and
that this wisdom, which in the minutest things gives evidence of
such an immense attention to order and use, has, no doubt,
framed the whole for some great purpose; but what that purpose
is, exceeds the present limits of the human understanding to discover.</p>

<h4>OF THE LEPAS ANATIFERA OR BARNACLE.<a href="#Footnote101" id="FNanchor101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></h4>

<p class="plateref"><a href="#Plate13">Plate XIII.</a> Fig. 1 and 2.</p>

<p>This is a tender and brittle shell-fish of a very peculiar species;
its length is about an inch, and its diameter about three
quarters of an inch. The shell is not composed of two pieces
or valves, as in others, but of five; two of these are larger than
the rest, to which are affixed two smaller ones; the fifth piece is
long, slender, and crooked, running down length-ways, and covering
the joinings of the other pieces. The shell part is of a
pale red, variegated with white; it adheres to a neck or pedicle
of an inch long, and about a fifth of an inch in diameter; by
which means it affixes itself to old wood, to stones, to sea-plants,
or any other solid substance that lies under water. It can shorten
or extend this neck at pleasure, which resembles a small gut, and
is usually full of a glareous liquor; it is composed of two membranes,
an external one, hard and brown, an internal one, soft<span class="pagenum" id="Page345">[345]</span>
and of an orange colour. The large portions of the shell open
and shut in the manner of the bivalves; the others, being moveable
by means of their membranaceous attachments, give way to
the opening of these, and to the motions of the body of the fish
in any direction. It is furnished with a cluster of filaments or
tentacida, placed in a row on each side, usually twelve, sometimes
fourteen in number. They are a kind of arms appropriated
for catching its prey, and therefore placed so as to surround
the mouth of the animal, which is situated between them, and
consequently easily receives what they thrust towards it. By the
motion of these arms, which may be exerted in such a manner as
to play either within or without the cavity of the shell, it forms
a current of water, which brings with it the prey it feeds upon.
Fig. 1 represents two of these arms as magnified by the microscope;
Fig. 2, the natural size of those from which these drawings
were made. Each arm consists of several joints, and each joint is
furnished on the concave side of the arm with a brush of fibrill&aelig;
or long hairs. The arms, when viewed in the microscope, seem
rather opake; but they maybe rendered transparent, and form a
most beautiful object, by extracting out of the interior cavity a
bundle of longitudinal fibres, which runs the whole length
of the arm. Mr. Needham<a href="#Footnote102" id="FNanchor102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> thinks the motion and use
of these arms illustrates the nature of that rotatory motion
which some writers have thought they discovered in the wheel
animal.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote101"><a href="#FNanchor101" class="label">[101]</a> This animal
is classed by Linn&aelig;us among the Vermes Testace&aelig;. Its generic character is:

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>In the midst of the arms is a hollow trunk, consisting of a
jointed fibrous or hairy tube, which incloses a long round tongue
or proboscis, that the animal can push occasionally out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page346">[346]</span>
tube or sheath, and retract at pleasure. The mouth of this animal
is singular in its kind, consisting of six lamin&aelig;, which go off
with a bend, indented like a saw on the convex edge, and by
their circular disposition are so ranged, that the teeth in the alternate
elevation and depression of each plate, act against whatever
intervenes between them. The plates are placed together in
such a manner, that to the naked eye they form an aperture not
much unlike the mouth of a contracted purse.</p>

<p>The western isles of Scotland, and some other parts of the
British dominions, are abundantly stored, at certain times of the
year, with a bird of the goose kind, commonly known in those
places by the name of the brent goose or barnacle. These birds
rarely breed with us, but seek, for their sitting season, islands less
frequented than those where we find them in common. The
seeing the birds so frequent, and yet never finding any of their
nests, induced ignorant people to believe they never had any, and
that they were not bred like other birds.</p>

<p>About the very shores where these birds are most common, the
lepas anatifera is also found in great abundance. The fishermen,
who observed vast quantities of these shells affixed to rotten
wood, or dead trees that were floating in the water, or lodged by
it on the shore, were soon led to imagine that the fibrous substances
that hung out of them resembled feathers, and persuaded
themselves that the geese, whose origin they could before by no
means make out, were bred from them, instead of being hatched,
like other birds, from eggs.<a href="#Footnote103" id="FNanchor103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> It was afterwards affirmed, that
the shells themselves originally grew on the trees, in the manner
of their fruit; and that the young bird, having in the shell obtained<span class="pagenum" id="Page347">[347]</span>
its plumage, dropt from thence into the water. From this
arose the opinion that the barnacle or brent goose was the produce
of a tree.<a href="#Footnote104" id="FNanchor104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote103"><a href="#FNanchor103" class="label">[103]</a> Hill&#8217;s Natural History of Animals.</p>

<p id="Footnote104"><a href="#FNanchor104" class="label">[104]</a> The absurd idea,
that the brent goose or barnacle derived its origin from this shell, was
not confined to the illiterate; men of science, incautiously confiding in the bold assertions of the
ignorant, appear to have given full credit to this truly curious hypothesis, and disseminated the
knowledge of it in their writings. Even Gerard, the author of the Herbal, caught the infection:
so confident was he of the fact, that he invited the credulous to apply to him for full satisfaction;
his words are, &#8220;For the truth hereof, if any do doubt, may it please them to repaire unto me,
and I shall satisfie them by the testimonie of good witnesses.&#8221; See his Herbal, page 1587.</p>

<p>Barbut says, &#8220;This fabulous account originated from the sea-fowls, when ready to lay their
eggs, depositing them on the marine plants; and, pecking sometimes these anatiferous shells,
oblige the fish to come out, which having devoured, they lay eggs in their place. The young
when hatched break through their prison, and fly away.&#8221; Genera Vermium, Pars ii. page 13. <span class="smcap">Edit.</span></p>

<h4>OF THE LEUCOPSIS DORSIGERA.</h4>

<p class="plateref"><a href="#Plate17">Plate XVII.</a> Fig. 1, 2, and 3.</p>

<p>This very beautiful and singular insect was first pointed out to
me by T. Marsham, Esq. Sec. L. S. who had seen it in the cabinet
of insects belonging to the Queen, in the royal observatory at
Richmond. Her Majesty was pleased to permit me to have the
drawing taken from it, from which this <a href="#Plate17">plate</a> was engraved.
When Mr. Marsham first saw it at Richmond, he considered it as
a non-descript insect, and an unique in this country. But he has
since found that it is mentioned by Fabricius, in his Systema Entomologi&aelig;,
as a new genus under the name of leucospis dorsigera.
There is one of the insects in the cabinet of the celebrated Linn&aelig;us,
now in the possession of J. E. Smith, M. D. F. R. S. &amp;
Pr. L. S. Sulz, and other writers, have also described it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page348">[348]</span></p>

<p>It appears at first sight like a wasp, to which genus the folded
wings would have given it a place, had not the remarkable sting
or tube on the back removed it from thence. It is probably a
species between, and uniting the sphex and wasp, in some degree
partaking of the characters of both. The antenn&aelig; are black
and cylindrical, increasing in thickness towards the extremity;
the joint nearest the head is yellow, the head is black, the thorax
is also black, encompassed round with a yellow line, and furnished
with a cross one of the same colour near the head. The
scutellum is yellow, the abdomen black, with two yellow bands,
and a spot of the same colour on each side between the bands.
A deep black polished groove extends down the back, from the
thorax to the anus, into which the sting turns and is deposited,
leaving the anus very circular; a yellow line runs on each side
the sting. The anus and the whole body, when viewed with a
shallow magnifier, appear punctuated; these points, when examined
in the microscope, appear hexagonal, as in the plate; and
in the center of each hexagon a small hair is to be seen; the feet
are yellow, the hinder thighs very thick and dentated, forming
also a groove for the next joint; they are yellow with black spots.
This insect is found in Italy, Switzerland, France, and Germany.
Fig. 1 shews it very much magnified; Fig. 2 is a side view of it
less magnified; Fig. 3 is the object of its real size.</p>

<h4>OF THE LOBSTER INSECT.</h4>

<p class="plateref"><a href="#Plate18">Plate XVIII.</a> Fig. 1 and 6.</p>

<p>This extraordinary little creature was found by my ingenious
friend, Mr. John Adams, of Edmonton; he was at the New Inn,
Waltham Abbey, where it was spied by some labouring men who
were drinking their porter. The man who first perceived it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page349">[349]</span>
thought it was of an uncommon form; on a more minute inspection,
it was supposed to be a louse with unusual long horns;
others thought it was a mite. This produced a debate, which
attracted the attention of my friend, who obtained the insect
from them for further observation. Mr. Martin has given some
account of it in the third volume of &#8220;The Young Gentleman
and Lady&#8217;s Philosophy.&#8221; Mr. Adams favoured me with the insect,
that an accurate drawing might be taken from it, which I
thought would be highly pleasing not only to the lovers of microscopic
observations, but also to the entomologist. It appears
to be quite a distinct species from the phalangium cancroides of
Linn&aelig;us, of which a good drawing has been given by Hooke,
R&ouml;sel, Sch&aelig;ffer, &amp;c.; it has also been described by Scopoli, Geoffroy,
and other naturalists; not one, however, of these descriptions
agrees with the animal under consideration. The abdomen
of this is more extended, the claws are larger and much more
obtuse; the body of the other being nearly orbicular, the claws
slender, and finishing almost in a point, more transparent, and of
a paler colour. It is very probable, that there are several species
nearly similar. Mr. Marsham has two in his possession, one like
the drawings of Reaumur, the other not to be distinguished from
that which is represented in the plate, except that it wants the
break or dent in the claws, so conspicuous in this. The latter he
caught on a flower in Essex, the first week in August, firmly
affixed by its claws to the thigh of a large fly, and could not disengage
it from thence without considerable difficulty; to accomplish
which, he was obliged to tear off the fly&#8217;s leg, and was much
surprized to see the bold little creature spring forward full a
quarter of an inch, and once more seize its prey, from which he
again found it very difficult to disengage it. Fig. 1 represents the
insect considerably magnified, Fig. 6 the natural size.<a href="#Footnote105" id="FNanchor105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote105"><a href="#FNanchor105" class="label">[105]</a> According to Aldrovandus,
this insect was not unknown to Aristotle, who mentions it as
being found in books and paper. Wolphius, on the authority of Gesner, says that a few are
to be met with in some parts of Switzerland. Scaliger also notices it, having found two of them
in his books. It has been by various systematic writers referred to different genera; De Geer
has instituted a new genus for it under the name of chelifer; Fabricius has remanded it to that
of scorpio, to which perhaps it is more nearly allied than any other.</p>

<p>Amongst the number of naturalists who have observed and described the insect, it appears
rather extraordinary that none have met with one similar to that in the plate, in respect to the
break in the claws. In a cabinet of curious microscopic objects which I purchased several years
since, and which originally came from Holland, there were four of them in the most perfect
condition. A botanical friend, Mr. Young, also favoured me with a living one which he found
among some plants collected by him in one of his excursions; but, as his box contained a variety
of plants, and he did not discover the insect till his return, it was impossible to ascertain the
particular one on which it was taken. All these resembled the one here exhibited, excepting the
claws being longer and more slender, and being deficient in the distinguishing characteristic;
I have lately seen another, in which the two fangs that are shewn highly magnified in Plate 85
of the Naturalist&#8217;s Miscellany, are very apparent, being so large, as to exceed in diameter the
thickest part of the claws.</p>

<p>My respectable friend, Matthew Yatman, Esq. informs me, that some years since one was
found on a bottle of wine packed in saw-dust, at the house in which he then resided in Percy
street; on putting the point of a pin towards it to remove it from the bottle, it ran backward,
put itself into an attitude of defence, and opened its claws as meditating vengeance. In the
same cellar one had many years previous been discovered, sufficiently large to admit its being
fastened to a card with thread by a young gentleman, being at least four times the usual size.</p>

<p>R&ouml;sel says it dwells among paper, in old books and their bindings, in chests of drawers, and
in the crevices of old buildings. In order to discover whether the insect possessed a sting, he
often by various means endeavoured to irritate it; but it never shewed the smallest inclination
to defend itself, on the contrary, it always endeavoured to avoid a contest; if so, it evidently
appears that those few met with in this country are of a more bold and warlike disposition.</p>

<p>Seba asserts that these insects resemble the large scorpions, the tail excepted, which is small,
and usually concealed by being drawn close to the under part of the abdomen; but in this
respect he must probably have been mistaken, as it does not appear that this circumstance has
been noticed by any other person. <span class="smcap">Edit.</span></p>

<h4>OF THE THRIPS PHYSAPUS.</h4>

<p class="plateref"><a href="#Plate18">Plate XVIII.</a> Fig. 3, 4, and 5.</p>

<p>The insect, which is represented very considerably magnified
at Fig. 3, is of the hemiptera class. It was first described and
figured by De Geer in the Swedish Transactions for 1744, under
the name of physapus ater, alis albis; Linn&aelig;us afterwards introduced
it in a subsequent edition of the Systema Natur&aelig; distinguished
by the name thrips physapus.</p>

<p>These insects live upon plants, and particularly in flowers.
The one figured here is the black thrips, with white wings; the
antenn&aelig; have six articulations; the body is black; the wings
whitish, long, and hairy; the head small, with two large reticular<span class="pagenum" id="Page351">[351]</span>
eyes. The antenn&aelig; are of an equal size throughout, and divided
into six oval pieces which are articulated together. The extremities
of the feet are furnished with a membranaceous and flexible
bladder, which it can throw out and draw in at pleasure. It
places and presses this bladder against the substances on which it
is walking, and seems to fix itself thereby to them; the bladder
sometimes appears concave towards the bottom, the concavity
increasing or diminishing in proportion to the degree of pressure.</p>

<p>They have four wings, two upper and two under ones; these
last are with great difficulty perceived, they are fixed to the
upper part of the breast, lying horizontally; both of them are
rather pointed towards the edges, and have a strong nerve running
round them, which is set with a fringe of fibrill&aelig;, tufted at
the extremity. The wings are represented by themselves at
Fig. 4; the insect of the real size at Fig. 5. They are to be
found in great plenty in the spring and summer, in the flowers of
the dandelion, and various other plants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page352">[352]</span></p>

<h4>OF THE SKIN OF THE LUMP SUCKER.</h4>

<p class="plateref"><a href="#Plate18">Plate XVIII.</a> Fig. 2 and 7.</p>

<p>For a full description of this singular fish, I must refer the
reader to Pennant&#8217;s British Zoology, vol. iii. p. 117. The Linnean
name is cyclopterus lumpus. Fig. 2 is a piece of the skin
highly magnified: there are no scales on the body, but a great
number of tubercles, which are here exhibited. Fig. 7 is the
natural size of the object.</p>

<p>These fishes being extremely fat, renders them an agreeable
diet to the natives of Greenland, in which seas they abound in
the months of April and May; they also resort in multitudes
during spring to the coast of Sutherland, near the Ord of Caithness
in North Britain, where the seals prey greatly upon them,
leaving the skins; numbers of which thus emptied float at that
season ashore. When a good specimen is procured, it forms a
most beautiful object for the opake microscope.</p>

<h4>OF THE CIMEX STRIATUS.</h4>

<p class="plateref"><a href="#Plate20">Plate XX.</a> Fig. 1 and A.</p>

<p>This is a beautiful insect of the hemiptera class, or that kind
where the elytra are only in part crustaceous, and which do not
form a longitudinal suture down the back, but fold over about
one-third of their length toward the bottom, where it is also
partly transparent. It is of the genus cimex, and called striatus
by Linn&aelig;us. Its colours are bright and elegantly disposed: the
head, proboscis, and thorax are black. The thorax is ornamented<span class="pagenum" id="Page353">[353]</span>
with yellow spots, the middle one large, and occupying almost
one-third of the posterior part; the other two are on each side,
and triangular. The scutellum has two yellow oblong spots,
pointed at each end; the ground of the elytra is a bright yellow,
spotted and striped with black. The nerves are yellow, and
there is a brilliant triangular spot of orange, which unites the
crustaceous and membranaceous parts; the latter is brown and
clouded. The feet are of a fine red, and the rings of the abdomen
are black, edged with white. This pretty insect is to be
found in June, upon the elm-tree. It is represented at A of the
natural size.</p>

<h4>OF THE CHRYSOMELA ASPARAGI.</h4>

<p class="plateref"><a href="#Plate20">Plate XX.</a> Fig. 2 and B.</p>

<p>A very common, though elegant insect of the coleoptera class,
is represented at Fig. 2, as seen in the lucernal microscope, and
of its natural size at B; it is called by Linn&aelig;us chrysomela asparagi,
from the larva feeding on the leaves of that plant. Its
shape is oblong, the antenn&aelig; black, composed of many joints
nearly oval. The head is of a bright, but deep blue; the thorax
red and cylindrical; the elytra blue, with a yellow margin, and
three spots of the same colour on each, one at the base of an
oblong form, and two united with the margin; the legs are
black, but the under side of the belly is of the same blue colour
with the elytra and head. This little animal, when viewed by
the naked eye, scarcely appears to deserve any notice; but when
examined by the microscope, is one of the most pleasing opake
objects we have. It is found in June, on the asparagus after it
has run to seed. De Geer says, that it is very scarce in Sweden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page354">[354]</span></p>

<h4>OF THE MELOE MONOCEROS.</h4>

<p class="plateref"><a href="#Plate20">Plate XX.</a> Fig. 3 and C.</p>

<p>The insect which comes at present under our inspection is particularly
adapted to shew the advantages of the microscope, which
alone will discover the peculiarities of its figure; this is so remarkable,
that entomologists appear undetermined as to its genus.
Geoffroy formed a new one for it, under the title of notoxus, in
which he has been followed by Fabricius; even Linn&aelig;us himself
could not determine at first where to place it, for in the Fauna
Suecica he makes it an attelabus, but in the last edition of the
Systema Natur&aelig; he has fixed it as a meloe, calling it the meloe
monoceros; but still he adds, &#8220;genus difficile terminatur forte
huic proximum.&#8221; Both Geoffroy and Sch&aelig;ffer have given figures
of it, but as they had not that kind of microscope which would
assist them, their figures are imperfect.</p>

<p>The head is black, and appears to be hid or buried under the
thorax, which projects forwards like a horn; the antenn&aelig; are
composed of many articulations, and with the feet are of a dingy
yellow. The hinder part of the thorax is reddish, the fore part
black. The elytra are yellow, with a black longitudinal line
down the suture; there is a band of the same colour near the
apex, and also a black point near the base; the whole animal is
curiously covered with hair. Geoffroy says it is found on umbelliferous
plants: the one here described was found in May; the
natural size is seen at C.</p>

<p class="plateref"><a href="#Plate19">Plate XIX.</a> Fig. 1 and 3,</p>

<p>Represent two magnified views of the feet of the monoculus
apus of Linn&aelig;us. They are curiously contrived to assist the<span class="pagenum" id="Page355">[355]</span>
animal in swimming, and form very agreeable objects for the
microscope. Fig. 2 and 4 are the same objects of the natural
size.</p>

<h4>OF THE SCALES OF FISH.</h4>

<p>The outside covering or scales of fish afford an immense variety
of beautiful objects for the microscope. They are formed in the
most admirable manner, and arranged with inconceivable regularity
and symmetry: some are long, others nearly round, others
again square; varying in shape, not only in different species, but
even considerably on the same fish; those which are taken from
one part not being entirely similar to those which are taken from
another.</p>

<p>Leeuwenhoeck supposed each scale to consist of an infinity of
scales laid one over the other; or, more simply, of an infinity
of strata, of which those next to the body of the fish are the
largest.</p>

<p>These strata, when viewed with the microscope, exhibit specimens
of wonderful mechanism and exquisite workmanship.
In some scales we discover a prodigious number of concentric
flutings, too fine, as well as too near each other, to be easily
enumerated; they are probably formed by the edges of each stratum,
denoting the limits thereof, and the different stages of the
growth of the scale. These flutings are often traversed by others
diverging from the center of the scale, and generally proceeding
from thence in a straight line to the circumference.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate10">Plate X.</a> Fig. 7, exhibits a scale from a species of the parrot
fish of the West-Indies, considerably magnified. Fig. 8, the real
size of the scale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page356">[356]</span></p>

<h2><span class="chapno">CHAP. VII.</span><br />
<span class="chapname">THE NATURAL HISTORY OF THE HYDRA, OR FRESH-WATER
POLYPE.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="startcapital">H</span>aving in the two preceding chapters given the reader such
a general idea of the history and &#339;conomy of a great variety of
those minute animated bodies, called insects, as I am inclined to
hope has not only afforded him entertainment and instruction,
but tended to excite an emulation for further researches; I shall
endeavour to gratify so laudable a disposition, by introducing
him to a class of beings whose &#339;conomy and singular properties
equally engage the attention of the philosopher and the natural
historian; a scene which opposes our general system of vitality,
and which presents to the eye of the mind, as well as that of the
body, a series of astonishing wonders. It is among the minuti&aelig;
of nature that we find her models most diversified, and displaying
the marvellous fecundity of its powers.</p>

<p>The polypes described in this chapter are fresh-water insects,
of the genus of hydra, of the order of zoophytes, and class of
vermes. The body consists of a single tube, furnished at one
end with long arms, by these it seizes small worms, and conveys
them to its mouth. It has, according to our general notions,
neither head, heart, stomach, nor intestines of any kind; and is<span class="pagenum" id="Page358">[358]</span>
without the distinction of sexes, yet extremely prolific. From
the simplicity of its structure those of its &#339;conomy and functions
are probably derived. When they are cut or divided into a number
of pieces, the separated parts in a very little time become so
many perfect and distinct animals; each piece having a power
of producing a head, a tail, and the other organs necessary for its
existence.</p>

<p>They are generally known by the name of polype; but as this
was thought by many to be improper, because that, strictly
speaking, they have no feet, Linn&aelig;us called the genus hydra,
probably from their property of re-producing the parts which are
cut off, a circumstance that naturally brings to mind the fabulous
story of the Lernean hydra. Dr. Hill called them biota, on account
of the strong principle of life with which every part is
endued.</p>

<p>Leeuwenhoeck, whose indefatigable industry in his researches
after small insects permitted very few things to escape his notice,
discovered these animals, and gave some account of them in the
Philosophical Transactions for the year 1703. There is also in
the same volume a letter from an anonymous hand on this subject.
We had, however, no regular account of them, their various habits,
their different species, or of their wonderful properties, till
the year 1740, when they first engaged the attention of M. Trembley,
to whose assiduity and observations we are indebted for the
display of their nature and &#339;conomy.</p>

<p>Previous to the successful experiments of this gentleman, Leibnitz
and Boerhaave, as well as some of the ancient philosophers,
reflecting on the various gradations in the scale of animated nature,
had endeavoured to prove that there might be degrees of
life between the animal and the plant, and that animals might be<span class="pagenum" id="Page359">[359]</span>
found which would propagate by slips, like plants. These conjectures
were verified by Trembley, but not in consequence of
any pre-conceived ideas in favour of such a supposition; on the
contrary, it was only by repeated observations that he could destroy
his own prejudices, and join these wonderful beings to the
animal kingdom.<a href="#Footnote106" id="FNanchor106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote106"><a href="#FNanchor106" class="label">[106]</a> A great part of
the knowledge of the ancients consisted in an extensive variety of ingenious
hypotheses, the result of intense study and application; and it need not excite surprize, if,
amongst a number of suppositions, some of them have since been found conformable to truth.</p>

<p>The moderns, animated by the example of the great Bacon, by an abundance of experiments
frequently repeated, and the assistance of good instruments, have introduced unquestionable
demonstration in the place of speculation; this renders the present philosophy very far superior
to that of the ancients.</p>

<p>Thus it is with respect to the subject now under consideration; many of the ancients conjectured
that animated beings might exist possessed of the wonderful properties of the hydra;
that some of them, however, were even witnesses of the fact, cannot well be disputed; though
it may be fairly presumed, that their knowledge of this animal, comparatively with that we are
now in possession of, was very circumscribed and imperfect.</p>

<p>St. Augustine relates that one of his friends performed the experiment before him, of cutting
a polype in two, and that immediately the two parts thus separated betook themselves to flight,
moving with precipitation different ways. The original passage is too long to be here inserted,
but may be found in his work &#8220;De Quantitate Anim&aelig;,&#8221; c. 62, p. 431, col. 1.</p>

<p>Aristotle, speaking of insects with many feet, expresses himself nearly in the same manner;
without naming the particular creatures to which he alludes, he observes, that there are of these
animals or insects, as well as of plants and trees, some that propagate themselves by shoots; and,
as what were but the parts of a tree before, become thus distinct and separate trees; so, in cutting
one of these animals, the pieces which before composed altogether but one animal, become suddenly
so many distinct individuals. And he adds, that the soul in these insects is in effect but one,
though multiplied in its powers, as it is in plants. Aristot. de Histor. Animal. tom. 1, lib. 4,
cap. 7, pag. 824, &amp; de Part. Animal. lib. 4, tom. 1, cap. 6, pag. 1029. &amp;c. This will suffice
to shew that the ancients were not entirely unacquainted with the subject before us; though it
does not derogate from the merit of Leeuwenhoeck, Trembley, and other ingenious naturalists,
by whose assiduous and patient investigations we have obtained a more perfect knowledge of
this astonishing class of animated beings. <span class="smcap">Edit.</span></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Though natural history is so fruitful in extraordinary facts, it
has hitherto produced none so singular as the various properties
of the different species of the hydra.</p>

<p>I shall endeavour, first, to trace the progress of this discovery,
in which we shall see with what sage caution and accuracy
Trembley, and other naturalists examined this wonderful ph&aelig;nomenon,
and what accumulated evidence was judged necessary to
establish the fact.</p>

<p>We find M. Trembley writing in January, 1741, to M. Bonnet,
that he did not know whether he should call the object which
then engaged his attention, a plant or an animal. &#8220;I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page360">[360]</span>
studied it,&#8221; says he, &#8220;ever since June last, and have found in it
striking characteristics of both plant and animal. It is a little
aquatic being. At first sight, every one imagines it to be a plant;
but if it be a plant, it is sensitive and ambulant; if it be an animal,
it may be propagated by slips or cuttings, like many plants.&#8221; It
was not till the month of March, in the same year, that he could
satisfy himself as to their nature.</p>

<p>When Reaumur saw, for the first time, two polypes formed
from one that he had divided into two parts, he could hardly
believe his eyes; and even after having repeated the operation an
hundred times, and again examined it an hundred more, he says
that the sight was not become familiar to him.</p>

<p>The first account the Royal Society received of the surprizing
properties of the hydra, was in a letter from M. Buffon, dated the
18th of July, 1741, to Martin Folkes, Esq. their president, acquainting
them with the discovery of a small insect called a
polypus, which is found sticking about the common duck weed,
and which, being cut in two, puts forth from the upper part a
tail, and from the lower end a head, so as to become two animals<span class="pagenum" id="Page361">[361]</span>
instead of one. If it be cut into three parts, the middlemost puts
out from one end a head, and from the other a tail, so as to become
three distinct animals, all living like the first, and performing
the various offices of their species: which observations are,
adds Buffon, well averred.</p>

<p>There is no ph&aelig;nomenon in all natural history more astonishing
than this, that man, at pleasure, should have a kind of creative
power, and out of one life make two, each completely formed
with all its apparatus and functions, its perceptions and powers
of motion and self-preservation; and as complete in all respects
as that from which they derived their existence, and equally enjoying
the humble gratifications of their nature.<a href="#Footnote107" id="FNanchor107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote107"><a href="#FNanchor107" class="label">[107]</a> Goldsmith&#8217;s History of the Earth and Animated Nature.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Mr. Folkes, in confirmation of the foregoing article, communicated
to the Society a letter from the Hon. W. Bentinck, Esq. at the
Hague, dated September, describing the insects discovered by Trembley,
adding, that he himself had seen them. In November, a letter
was read from Dr. Gronovius, of Leyden, giving an account of a
water insect not yet known to, or described by any author; after
describing it, he adds, &#8220;but what is more surprizing, if this animal
is cut into five or six pieces, in a few hours there will be as
many animals, exactly similar to their parent.&#8221; The accounts of
this animal were so extraordinary, that they were not credited
until Professors Albinus and Musschenbroeck were provided with
some specimens, and found all that had been related thereof to be
exactly true.</p>

<p>November 25, a letter from Cambridge was read to the Royal
Society, in which the author endeavours to lessen, by reason, the
prejudices which then combated the belief of these facts. &#8220;Some<span class="pagenum" id="Page362">[362]</span>
of our friends,&#8221; says the author, &#8220;who are firmly attached to the
general metaphysical notions they have formerly learned, reason
strongly against the possibility of such a fact: but I have myself
owned on other occasions, my distrust of the truth, or certainty
at least, of some of those principles, and I shall make no scruple
of acknowledging, that I have already seen so many strange
things in nature, that I am become very diffident of all general
assertions, and very cautious in affirming what may or may not
possibly be. The most common operations both of the animal
and vegetable world, are all in themselves astonishing, and nothing
but daily experience and constant observation can make us
see without amazement an animal bring forth another of the same
kind, or a tree blossom and bear leaves and fruit.</p>

<p>&#8220;The same observation and experience make it also familiar to
us, that, besides the first way of propagating vegetables from their
respective fruit and seed, they are also propagated from cuttings,
and every one knows that a twig of a willow particularly, cut off
and only stuck into the ground, does presently take root and
grow, and become as real and perfect a tree as the original one
from which it was taken. Here then we find in the vegetable
kingdom quite common, the very thing of which we have an
example before us in the animal kingdom, in this new-discovered
insect. The best philosophers have long observed strong analogies
between these two classes of beings; and the more they
have penetrated into nature, the more they have extended this
analogy: now in such a scale, who is the man that will be bold
to say, just here animal life entirely ends, and here vegetable life
begins? or, just so far, and no farther, one sort of operation goes;
and just here another sort, quite different, takes its place? or
again, who will venture to say, life in every animal is a thing
absolutely different from that which we dignify by the same
name in every vegetable?&#8221; Thus does the author endeavour to<span class="pagenum" id="Page363">[363]</span>
persuade the prejudiced, and lead them to pay attention to the
facts which were now laid open to their view, and which were
further confirmed by a letter from M. Trembley, in January 1740;
which letter was strengthened by an extract from the preface to
the sixth volume of Reaumur&#8217;s history of insects. In March,
1742, Mr. Folkes gave an account of them to the Royal Society,
from observations made on several polypes which had been sent
by M. Trembley from Holland to him. The insects now began
to be known, and were soon found in England, and the experiments
that had been made on them abroad were published by
Mr. Folkes,<a href="#Footnote108" id="FNanchor108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
my father,<a href="#Footnote109" id="FNanchor109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> and
Mr. Baker:<a href="#Footnote110" id="FNanchor110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> conviction now became
too strong for argument, and metaphysical objections gave
way to facts. The animal is described in the following manner:</p>

<p id="Footnote111"><a href="#FNanchor111" class="label">[111]</a> The hydr&aelig; or polypes
have generally been denominated Insects: is there not a manifest
impropriety in the application of this term to them? If we admit of the systematic arrangement
of <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>, we find that he has divided the animal kingdom into six classes: 1. Mammalia.
2. Aves. 3. Amphibia. 4. Pisces. 5. <i>Insecta</i>; and 6. <i>Vermes</i>. Of the last or <i>Vermes</i>,
the Zoophytes (from &#950;&#969;&#959;&#966;&#965;&#964;&#959;&#957;, or animal plant) constitute the fifth order. He defines it
as Animalia composita, efflorescentia more vegetabilium: amongst these he includes the
various species of Vorticell&aelig; and Hydr&aelig;.</p>

<p>The term animalcul&aelig;, or small animals, is certainly not inapplicable to them, but they differ
materially in the peculiar characteristics by which insects are distinguished, see <a href="#Page179">page 179</a>, and
<a href="#Page215">pages 215</a>-<a href="#Page220">220</a>.
They do not undergo those transformations to which insects are subject, and
which have been so fully described in the preceding part of this work: their figure, habits, and
&#339;conomy are also very different. In short, they seem to be in every respect, except their minuteness,
quite a distinct race of animated beings, as will be more fully exemplified in the following
pages. <span class="smcap">Edit.</span></p>

<p>This animal fixes itself by its base, it is gelatinous, linear,
naked, can contract itself, and change its place. Its mouth, which
is at one end, is surrounded by hair, like feelers. It sends forth
its young ones from its sides, which drop off.</p>

<h4>OF THE HYDRA VIRIDIS, HYDRA FUSCA, AND
HYDRA GRISEA.</h4>

<p class="plateref"><a href="#Plate21">Plate XXI.</a> and <a href="#Plate23A">XXIII.</a></p>

<p>These three species of the hydra having been those on which
the greatest number of experiments have been made, and of which
we have the best information, it is of these only I shall speak
in the following account, unless it is particularly mentioned
otherwise.</p>

<p>There are few animals more difficult to describe than the
hydra, as it has scarce any thing constant in its form, varying
continually in its figure: they are often so beset with young, as
to appear ramose and divaricated, the young ones constituting as
it were a part of the parent&#8217;s body.</p>

<p>Whoever has looked with care at the bottom of a wet shallow
ditch, when the water is stagnant, and the sun has been powerful,
may remember to have seen many little transparent lumps, of a
jelly-like appearance, about the size of a pea, and flatted on one<span class="pagenum" id="Page366">[366]</span>
side; the same appearances are also often to be seen on the under
side of the leaves of those weeds or plants that grow on the surface
of the water; these are the hydr&aelig; gathered up into a quiescent
state, and seemingly inanimate, because either undisturbed or not
excited by the calls of appetite to action. They are generally fixed
by one end to some solid substance, at the other end there is a
large opening, round about which the arms are placed as so many
rays round a center, which center is the mouth.</p>

<p>They are slender and pellucid, formed of a tender kind of substance,
in consistence something like the horns of a snail, and can
contract the body into a very small compass, or extend it to a
considerable length. They can do the same with the arms; with
these they seize minute worms and various kinds of aquatic insects,
bring them to the mouth, and swallow them. After the
food is digested, and the nutritive parts which are employed in
sustaining its life are separated from the rest, they reject the
remainder by the mouth.</p>

<p>The first polype which Trembley discovered was one of the
hydra viridis, represented in <a href="#Plate21">Plate XXI.</a> Fig. 5. These are generally
of a fine green colour. The indications of spontaneous motion
were first perceived in the arms of these little creatures; they
can extend or contract, bend and wind them divers ways. Upon
the slightest touch they contract themselves so much, as to appear
little more than a grain of a green substance, the arms disappearing
entirely. He soon after found the hydra grisea, Fig. 6, and
saw it eat, swallow, and digest worms much larger than itself.
This discovery was soon followed by that of the hydra fusca,
Fig. 7.</p>

<p>The most general attitudes of these hydr&aelig; are those which are
represented in Fig. 5 and 6 of the same plate. They fix the posterior<span class="pagenum" id="Page367">[367]</span>
extremity <i>b</i> against a plant or other substance, as <i>e f</i>; the
body <i>a b</i>; and the arms <i>a c</i>, being extended in the water. There
is a small difference in the attitudes of the three kinds which we
are now describing.</p>

<p>The bodies of the hydra viridis, Fig. 5, and of the hydra grisea,
Fig. 6, diminish from the anterior to the posterior extremity by
an almost insensible gradation. The hydra fusca does not diminish
in the same gradual manner, but from the anterior extremity
<i>a</i>, to the part <i>d</i>, which is often two-thirds of the length of their
body, it is nearly of an equal size; from this part it becomes abruptly
smaller, and goes on from thence of a regular size to the
end. The number of arms in these three kinds are at least six,
and at most twelve or thirteen, though eighteen may sometimes
be found on the hydra grisea. They can contract their bodies till
they are not above one-tenth of an inch in length; they can also
stop at any intermediate degree, either of contraction or extension,
from the greatest to the least. The species represented at
Fig. 5, are generally about half an inch long when stretched out.
Those exhibited at Fig. 6 and 7, are about three-fourths of an
inch, or one inch in length, though some are to be found at times
about an inch and half long. The arms of the hydra viridis,
Fig. 5, are seldom longer than their bodies; those of Fig. 6 are
commonly one inch long, while those of Fig. 7 are generally about
eight inches; whence Trembley has called it the long-armed
polype.</p>

<p>The bulk of the hydr&aelig; decreases, in proportion as they extend
themselves, and vice versa. They may be made to contract themselves,
either by touching them, or agitating the water in which
they are contained. They all contract themselves so much when,
taken out of the water, as to appear only like a little lump of
jelly. They can contract or extend their arms without extending<span class="pagenum" id="Page368">[368]</span>
or contracting the body, or the body, without making any alteration
in the arms; or they can contract or dilate only some of the
arms, independent of the rest: they can also bend their body and
arms in all possible directions. Those represented at Fig. 7 let
their arms in general hang down, making different turns and returns,
often directing some of them back again to the top of the
water. They can also dilate the body at different places, sometimes
at one part, and then again at another; sometimes they are
thick set with folds, which, if carelessly viewed, might be taken
for rings.</p>

<p>They have a progressive motion, which is performed by that
power by which they stretch out, contract, and turn themselves
every way. For suppose the hydra or polype, <i>a b</i>, Fig. 16, to be
fixed by the tail <i>b</i>, having the body and the arms <i>a</i> extended in
the water; in order to advance, it draws itself together, by bending
itself so as to bring the head and arms down to the substance
on which it is to move; to do this, it fixes the head or the arms
as in Fig. 17; when these are well fixed, it loosens the tail, and
draws it towards the head, as in Fig. 18, which it again loosens,
and resting on the tail, stretches it out, as in Fig. 19. It is easy
to see from this account, that their manner of walking is very
analogous to that of various terrestrial and aquatic animals.
They walk very slow, often stopping in the middle of a step,
turning and winding their body and arms every way. Their step
is sometimes very singular, as in the following instance: suppose
the polype <i>a b</i>, Fig. 20, to be fixed by the tail <i>b</i>, the body and
arms being extended in the water, it first bends the fore-part
towards the substance on which it is moving, and fixes it thereto,
as at <i>a</i>, Fig. 21; it then loosens the lower end, and raises it up
perpendicular, as in Fig. 22; now bending the body to the other
side, it fixes the tail, as in Fig. 23; then loosening the anterior
end, it rises up, as in Fig. 24.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page369">[369]</span></p>

<p>They descend at pleasure to the bottom of the water, and ascend
again, either by the sides, or upon some aquatic plants;
they often hang from the surface of the water, resting as it were
upon the tail; or, at other times they are suspended by one arm
from it. They walk also with ease upon the surface of the water.
If the extremity of the tail <i>b</i>, Fig. 7, be examined with a magnifying
glass, a small part of it will be found to be dry, and above
the surface of the water, and as it were in a little concave space,
of which the tail forms the bottom, so that it seems to be suspended
on the surface of the water, on the same principle that a
small pin or needle is made to swim.</p>

<p>Hence, when a polype means to pass from the sides of the
glass to the surface of the water, it has only to put that part out
of the water by which it means to be supported, and give it time
to dry, which it always does upon these occasions. They attach
themselves so firmly by the tail to aquatic plants, stones, &amp;c. as
not to be easily driven from the place where they have fixed themselves;
they often further strengthen these attachments by means
of one or two of their arms, which they throw out and fix to
adjacent substances, as so many anchors.</p>

<p>The mouth of the polype or hydra is situated at the fore-part
of the body, in the middle between the shooting forth of the
arms. The mouth assumes different appearances, according to
the different purposes of the insect; sometimes it is lengthened
out, and forms a little conical nipple, as in <a href="#Plate23A">Plate XXIII. A.</a> Fig.
13; sometimes it appears truncated, as in <a href="#Plate21">Plate XXI.</a> Fig. 8; at
other times the interval between the arms appears closed, as in
<a href="#Plate23A">Plate XXIII. A.</a> Fig. 2 and 12; or hollow, as in Fig. 11 of the
same plate. If it be observed with a deep magnifier in either of
the two last cases, a small aperture may be discovered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page370">[370]</span></p>

<p>The mouth of the polype opens into the stomach, which is a
kind of bag or gut that goes from head to tail; this may be perceived
by the naked eye, when the animal is exposed to a strong
light, or a candle placed on the opposite side to the eye; for the
colour of the polype does not destroy the transparency thereof.
The stomach will, however, be better seen, if the eye be assisted
by a deep magnifier; one of them is represented as highly magnified
in <a href="#Plate21">Plate XXI.</a> Fig. 8. To be fully satisfied whether they
were perforated throughout, Trembley cut one transversely into
three parts; each piece immediately contracted itself, and became
very short; being then placed in a shallow glass full of water,
and viewed through the microscope, they were found to be visibly
perforated. Their microscopic appearance is represented in
<a href="#Plate23A">Plate XXIII. A.</a> Fig. 6, 7, 8; its mouth was at the anterior end <i>a</i>,
Fig. 8, of one of these parts. The tail was at the end <i>b</i> of the
third part, Fig. 6; as this piece was also perforated, it plainly
appears that the tail of the hydra is open. The perforation,
which is thus continued from one end to the other, is called the
stomach, because it contains and digests the aliments. The skin
which incloses the bag, and forms the stomach, is the skin of the
polype itself; so that the animal may be said to consist of but
one skin, disposed in the form of a tube or gut open at both ends.
On opening the polype, no vessels are to be distinguished; and
whatever be the nature of its organization, it must reside in the
skin.</p>

<p>The skin must be so far organized, as to perform all the operations
necessary for the nutrition and growth of the animal, without
considering those that are necessary for its various motions.
Whatever are the means the Author of Nature has employed
for these purposes, we are ignorant of them. If their skin be
examined by a microscope, it appears like shagreen, or as if it<span class="pagenum" id="Page371">[371]</span>
were covered with little grains; these are more or less separated
from each other, according to the degree in which the body is
extended or contracted.</p>

<p>If the lips of a polype be cut transversely, and placed so that
the cut part of the skin may lie directly before the microscope,
the skin throughout its whole thickness will be found to consist
of an infinite number of these grains. To know whether the
inside of the stomach was formed of similar grains, several of them
have been laid open and examined by the microscope; the interior
surface was then found to consist of an immense number of
them, being as it were more shagreened than the exterior one,
and less transparent. The grains are not strongly united to each
other, but may be separated without much trouble. <a href="#Plate23A">Plate XXIII. A.</a>
Fig. 10, represents a piece of skin thus laid open. To examine
these particulars further, a piece of skin a, Fig. 9, was laid in a
few drops of water, on a piece of glass before the microscope,
and some of the grains were separated from it, as at b c d, by
pressing them with the point of a pin; in endeavouring to open
them, they spread themselves into all parts of the water, and at
last remained in heaps, as at e and f.</p>

<p>If a polype be carefully placed before the microscope, without
wounding it, you will seldom be disappointed in seeing some of
these grains detach themselves from the superficies thereof, and
that even in the most healthy.</p>

<p>But if the grains separate themselves in large quantities, it is
the symptom of a very dangerous disorder; the surface of the
polype thus attacked becomes more and more irregular, and is no
longer well terminated and defined as before. The grains fall off
on all sides, the body and arms contract and dilate, it becomes of
a white shining colour, loses its form as at a, Fig. 4, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page372">[372]</span>
dissolves into a heap of grains, as at b, Fig. 5. The progress of
this disorder is most easily observed in the hydra viridis.</p>

<p>A very attentive and accurate examination shews that the skin
is formed of a kind of glareous substance, a species of gum, which
fills up the intervals between the grains, in which they are
lodged, and by which they are attached, though weakly, together.
It has been already observed, that it is to these grains that it owes
its shagreen-like appearance; it is from them also that it derives
its colour; for, when they are separated from the polype, they
are the same colour with it, whereas the glareous matter is without
any distinguishing colour. The construction of the polype
seems then to be confined to these glandular grains, to the viscous
matter, and the invisible fibres which act upon the glareous substance.</p>

<p>The structure of the arms of the polypes is very analogous to
that of their body. When they are examined by the microscope,
either in a contracted or dilated state, their surface is shagreened;
if the arm be much contracted, it appears more so than the body;
on the contrary, it appears less so in proportion as they are more
extended; almost quite smooth when at their full extension; so
that in the hydra viridis the appearance of the arms is continually
varying, and these variations are more sensible towards the extremity
of the arm than at its origin, as, in <a href="#Plate21">Plate XXI.</a> Fig. 10;
but more thinly scattered, or farther asunder, in the parts further
on, as at Fig. 9. The hairs which are exhibited in this figure
cannot be seen without a very deep magnifier, however they indicate
a further degree of organization in this little animal. The
extremity is often terminated by a knob.</p>

<p>All animals of this kind have a remarkable attachment to turn
towards the light, and this might naturally induce the inquirer to<span class="pagenum" id="Page373">[373]</span>
look for their eyes; but how carefully soever this search has been
pursued, and however excellent the microscope with which every
part has been examined, yet no appearance of this organ has been
found. Notwithstanding this, they constantly turn themselves
toward the light; so that if that part of the glass in which we
placed them be turned from it, they will be found the next day
to have removed themselves to the side that is next the light, and
the dark side will be quite depopulated.</p>

<h4>OF THE FOOD OF THE HYDR&AElig;, AND THEIR METHOD OF SEIZING
AND SWALLOWING THEIR PREY.</h4>

<p>As the hydra fusca, <a href="#Plate21">Plate XXI.</a> Fig. 7, has the longest arms, its
manner of feeding, and the different man&#339;uvres it makes use of
to seize and manage its prey, are more remarkable than those of
the two other species; it will be, therefore, this kind only which
will be principally spoken of under the present head. To obtain
a proper view, it should be placed in a glass seven or eight inches
deep. If the polype be fixed near the top of the glass, the arms
for the most part hang down toward the bottom. This is a very
convenient situation for feeding it, and observing its management
of the food.</p>

<p>The polypes are in general very voracious: an hungry one
extends its arms as a fisherman his nets; it spreads them every
way, so that they form a circle of considerable extent, every part
of which is entirely within the reach of one of them. In this
expanded posture it lies in expectation of its food; whatever
comes within the verge of this circle is seized by one or other of
its arms: the arms are then contracted till the prey is brought to
the mouth, when it is soon devoured. While the arms are contracting
and exerting themselves vigorously to counteract the
efforts of the animal, which it has seized, to escape, they may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page374">[374]</span>
observed to swell like the muscles of the human body when they
are in a state of exertion.</p>

<p>Though in general all ideas are derived from the senses, there
are certainly some that seem infused into us independently of the
exertions of any sense. This may be confirmed by many instances
of animal instinct; among others, it may be illustrated by
the polype. Who taught it, when just separated from the parent
stock, to expand its arms, that it might catch its prey? That its
native element abounded with insects? or that these were its
proper food? No sense that we are acquainted with could first
give the information.</p>

<p>The polype does not always wait for its prey, it feels for it,
and in a manner follows it. It may be asked how can it perform
this if destitute of vision? or do the glandular grains answer
the purpose of eyes? Who can answer the question? what are
our own eyes but glandular grains of a larger size? If this should
be the case, our hydra, like the libellul&aelig; and other insects, would
realize, nay, exceed the fables of the ancients, being an Argus
entirely composed of eyes. Be this as it may, they are certainly
in possession of some sensation by which they are informed of
the approach of their prey, and which renders them attentive to
all that may confirm or destroy this perception.</p>

<p>When the arms of a polype are extended within a glass, put a
centipe or any kind of worm into it, see <a href="#Plate24A">Plate XXIV. A.</a> Fig. 1,
and with the point of a pin push it towards one of the arms; as
soon as it touches this it is seized; the worm or centipe endeavours
by quick and strong efforts to disengage itself, often swimming
and dragging the arm from one side of the glass to the other.
This violent motion of the prey obliges the polype to contract
strongly the arm; in doing which, it often twists it in the form<span class="pagenum" id="Page375">[375]</span>
of a cork-screw, as at o i, by which means it shortens it more
rapidly. The struggles of the devoted animal soon bring it in
contact with another arm; these contracting further, the little
creature is presently engaged with all the arms, and by degrees
conveyed to the mouth, against which it is held and subdued.</p>

<p>When a polype has nothing to eat, its mouth is generally open,
but so small, that it can scarce be perceived without the assistance
of a magnifying glass; but as soon as the arms have conveyed the
prey to the mouth, it opens itself wider, and this in proportion to
the size of the animal that is to be devoured; the lips gradually
dilate, and adjust themselves accurately to the figure of the prey.
The greatest part of the animals on which the polype feeds, are
to its mouth, what an apple the size of our heads would be to the
mouth of a man.</p>

<p>The worms or other minute animals which are seized by the
polype, are not always brought to the mouth in the same situation;
if they be presented to it by one of their extremities, it is
not requisite that the polype should open its mouth considerably,
and in effect it only opens it so wide, as precisely to give entrance
to the worm, Fig. 5. If it be not too long for the stomach,
it remains there extended; but if it be longer, the end which
first enters is bent, so that when the worm is entirely swallowed,
it may be seen lying folded in the stomach, <a href="#Plate24B">Plate XXIV. B.</a>
Fig. 12.</p>

<p>If the middle, or any other part of the worm, be presented to
the mouth of the polype, it seizes this part with the lips, extending
them on both sides, and applying them against the worm, so
that the mouth assumes the form of a boat, pointed at each end,
<a href="#Plate24A">Plate XXIV. A.</a> Fig. 2; the polype gradually closes the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page376">[376]</span>
points of its boat-like lips, and by this motion and suction swallows
the worm, Fig. 4.</p>

<p>The polypes kill worms so speedily, that Fontana thinks they
must contain the most active and powerful venom; for the lips of
a polype scarce touch the worm, but it expires, so great is the
energy of the poison it conveys into it, though no wound can be
observed in the dead animal.</p>

<p>As soon as the stomach is filled, its capacity is enlarged, the
body is shortened, <a href="#Plate24A">Plate XXIV. A.</a> Fig. 6, the arms are for the
most part contracted, the polype hangs down without motion,
and appears to be in a kind of stupor, and very different from its
shape when extended; but in proportion as the food is digested,
and it has voided the excrementitious parts, the body lengthens,
and gradually recovers its usual form.</p>

<p>The transparency of the polype permits us to see distinctly the
worm it has swallowed, <a href="#Plate24B">Plate XXIV. B.</a> Fig. 12, which gradually
loses its form. It is at first macerated in the stomach of the polype,
and when the nutritious juices are separated from it, the
remainder is discharged by the mouth, Fig. 13. It is with these,
as with other voracious animals, as they devour a great quantity
of food at once, so also they can fast for a long time. The history
of insects furnishes many examples of this kind.</p>

<p>One circumstance is observable, which probably contributes
much to the digestion of their food, namely, that the aliments are
continually pushed backward from one extremity of the stomach
to the other; this motion may be easily observed with a microscope,
in a polype which is not too full, and in which the food
has been already divided into little fragments. For these observations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page377">[377]</span>
it is best to feed the polype with such food as will give a
lively-coloured juice; as for example, those worms whose intestines
are filled with red substances: for by these means we shall
see that the nutritious juices are conveyed not only to the extremity
of the body, but also into the arms; from whence it is probable
that each of the arms form also a kind of gut, which communicates
with that of the body. Some bits of a small black
snail that is frequently to be found in our ditches, was given to a
polype. The substance of this skin was soon reduced into a
pulp, consisting of little black fragments; on examining the polype
with the microscope, these particles were perceived to be
driven about the stomach, and to pass from head to tail, and into
their arms, even where these were as fine as a thread; they were
afterwards forced into the stomach, and from thence to the tail,
from whence they were again driven into the arms, and so on.</p>

<p>The grains take their tinge from the food which nourishes the
polypes; these grains become red or black, if the polype be fed
with juices that are either red or black; and they are more or less
tinged with these different colours, in proportion to the strength
and quantity of the nutritive juices. It is also observable, that
they lose their colour if fed with aliments that are not of the same
colour with themselves.</p>

<p>The polypes feed on the greater part of those insects that are
to be found in fresh water. They may be nourished with worms,
the larv&aelig; of gnats, &amp;c. they will also eat larger animals if they
are cut into small pieces, as snails, large aquatic insects, small
fish, butcher&#8217;s meat, &amp;c. Sometimes two polypes seize the same
worm, and each begins to swallow its own end, continuing so
to do till their mouths meet, <a href="#Plate24A">Plate XXIV. A.</a> Fig. 8; in this position
they remain for some time, at last the worm breaks, and
each has its share; sometimes the combat does not end here, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page378">[378]</span>
each continuing to dispute the prize, one of the polypes opens its
mouth advantageously, and swallows the other with its portion
of the worm, <a href="#Plate24B">Plate XXIV. B.</a> Fig. 14; this combat ends more
fortunately for the devoured polype than might be at first expected,
for the other often gets the prey out of its stomach, but
lets it out again sound and safe, after having imprisoned it above
an hour. From hence we learn, that the stomach of the polype,
which so soon dissolves the animal substances which are conveyed
into it, is not capable of digesting that of another polype.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate24A">Plate XXIV. A.</a> Fig. 5, represents a polype with one half a

<h4>OF THE GENERATION OF THE HYDR&AElig;.</h4>

<p>As the hydra fusca and the hydra grisea are considerably larger
than the hydra viridis, it is more easy to observe the manner of
their producing their young. It is upon these, therefore, that
most of the observations here recited have been made. If one of
them be examined in summer, when the animals are most active,
and more particularly prepared for propagation, it will be found
to shoot forth from its side several little tubercles, or knobs,
which grow larger and larger every day; after two or three days
inspection, what at first appeared but a small excrescence, takes
the figure of a small animal, entirely resembling its parent. It
does not inclose a young polype, but is the real animal in miniature,
united to the parent, as a sucker to the tree.</p>

<p>When a young polype first begins to shoot, the excrescence
terminates in a point, as at e, <a href="#Plate24B">Plate XXIV. B.</a> Fig. 24; so that it
is rather of a conical figure, and of a deeper colour than that of
the body. This cone soon becomes truncated, and in a little
time appears cylindrical. The arms then begin to shoot from the
anterior end c i. The tail adheres to the body of the parent, but
grows gradually smaller, till at last it only adheres by a point b,
Fig. 23, it is then ready to be separated; for this purpose the mother
and young ones fix themselves to the glass, or other substance
upon which they may be situated. They have then only
to give a sudden jerk, and they are divided from each other.
There are some trifling differences to be observed now and then
in their performing this operation, which it would be too tedious
to enumerate here. A polype, a b, Fig. 20, with a young one,
c d, places its body in an arch of a circle a d b, against the sides of
the glass, the young one being fixed at the top d of the arch, with
its head also fixed against the glass; so that the mother, by contracting<span class="pagenum" id="Page380">[380]</span>
the body, and thus becoming straight, loosens herself from
the young one.</p>

<p>The young ones shoot in proportion to the warmth of the
weather, and the nature of the food eaten by the mother; some
have been observed to be perfectly formed in twenty-four hours,
while others have required fifteen days for the same purpose; the
first were produced in the midst of summer, the latter in a cold
season.</p>

<p>The tail of the young polype communicates with, and partakes
of the food from the parent in the same manner as its own arms
do, and the food lies in the same manner as in the arms. When
this f&#339;tus is furnished with arms, it catches its prey, swallows,
digests, and distributes the juices thereof even to the parent body;
every good is common to each. Here then we have evident
communication between the f&#339;tus and the mother; this communication
was further proved by the following experiment. A
large polype, one of the hydra fusca, was placed on a slip of
paper, in a little water; the middle of the body of the young one
was cut, and the superior part of that end which remained fixed
to the parent was found to be open. The parent polype was
then cut on each side of the shoot. Thus a short cylinder was
obtained, which was open at both ends. This being viewed
through a microscope, the light was seen to come through the
side slip, or young one, into the stomach of the old one. For
further conviction, the cylindrical portion was cut lengthways;
on observing these parts, not only the hole t of the communication,
<a href="#Plate24B">Plate XXIV. B.</a> Fig. 17, was distinctly seen, but one
might see through the end o of the young one. On changing
the situation of these two pieces of prepared polypes, and looking
through the opening e, Fig. 18, the day-light was seen through
the hole of communication i.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page381">[381]</span></p>

<p>This communication, between the parent polype and its young
ones may be seen on feeding them; for, after the parent a b,
<a href="#Plate24B">Plate XXIV. B.</a> Fig. 22, has eaten, the bodies of the young ones
swell, being filled with the aliments as if they themselves had
been eating. In the hydra fusca the young ones do not proceed
from the tail part b c, <a href="#Plate23B">Plate XXIII. B.</a> Fig. 16, but only from the
part a c, with this exception, there is no particular part of the
body before the rest, on which they produce their young. Some
of them have been so closely observed, and have so greatly multiplied,
that there would be scarce any impropriety in saying they
produced their young ones from all the exterior parts of their
body. A polype puts forth frequently five or six young ones at
the same time. Trembley has had some that have produced nine
or ten at the same time, and when one dropped off another came
in its place.</p>

<p>Though this gentleman had for two years thousands of them
under his eye, and considered them with the most scrupulous
attention, he never observed any thing like copulation. To be
more certain on this head, he took two young ones the instant
they came from their parent, and placed them in separate glasses;
they both multiplied, not only themselves, but their offspring,
which were separated and watched in the same manner to the
seventh generation; nay, they have even the faculty of multiplying
while they adhere to the parent. The arms of the young
ones do not sprout till the body has attained some length.</p>

<p>Several excrescences or buds often appear at the same time on
a polype, which are so many polypes growing from one trunk;
whilst these are developing, they also bud, which buds again put
forth little ones, the parent and the young ones forming a singular
kind of animal society, in which all participate of the same
life, and the same wants. In this state, the parent appears like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page382">[382]</span>
shrub thick set with branches. Several generations are often thus
attached to one another, and all to the parent polype; after a
time, this tree of polypes or hydr&aelig; is decomposed, and gives
birth to new generations, or fresh genealogical trees. Here we
see a surprizing chain of existence continued, and numbers of
animals naturally produced, without any union of sexes; every
polype raising a numerous posterity by a kind of animal vegetation.</p>

<p>From Fig. 16, <a href="#Plate23B">Plate XXIII. B.</a> the reader may form an idea of
the promptitude with which these creatures increase and multiply;
the whole group formed by the parent and its young was about
an inch and an half long, and one inch broad, the arms of the
mother and her nineteen little ones hanging down towards the
bottom of the vessel; the animal would eat about twelve monoculi
per day, and the little ones about twenty among them, or
rather more than thirty for the group.</p>

<h4>OF THE RE-PRODUCTION OF THE HYDR&AElig;.</h4>

<p>So strange is the nature of this creature&#8217;s life, that the method
by which other animals are killed and destroyed becomes a
means of propagating these. When divided and cut to pieces in
every direction that fancy can suggest, it not only continues to
exist, but each section becomes an animal of the same kind.</p>

<p>A polype cut transversely or longitudinally, in two or three
parts, is not destroyed; each part in a little time becomes a perfect
polype. This species of fecundity is so great in these animals,
that even a small portion of their skin will become a little
polype, a new animal rising as it were from the ruins of the old,
each small fragment yielding a polype. If the young ones be
mutilated while they grow upon the parent, the mutilated parts<span class="pagenum" id="Page383">[383]</span>
are re-produced; the same changes succeed also in the parent.
A truncated portion will put forth young before it is perfectly
formed itself, or has acquired its new head and tail; sometimes
the head of the young one supplies the place of that which would
grow out of the anterior part of the trunk.</p>

<p>If a polype be slit, beginning at the head, and proceeding to the
middle of the body, a polype will be formed with two heads, and
will eat at the same time with both. If the polype be slit into
six or seven parts, it becomes a hydra with six or seven heads.
If these be again divided, we shall have one with fourteen; cut
off these, and as many new ones will spring up in their place,
and the heads thus cut off will become new polypes, of which so
many new hydr&aelig; may again be formed; so that in every respect
it exceeds the fabulous relation of the Lernean hydra.</p>

<p>As if the wonders already related of the polype were not sufficient
to engage our attention to these singular animals, new
circumstances, as surprizing as the foregoing, present themselves
to convince us of the imperfection of our ideas of animality, and
of the greatness of the power of our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> and <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>, who is
the source and origin of every degree of life, in all its immense
gradations, as unity is the origin of number in all its varied series,
multiplied proportions and combinations; and as numbers
may be considered as recipient of unity, in order to make manifest
the wonderful powers thereof, so the universe and its parts
are adapted to receive life from the source of all life, and thus
become representatives of his immensity and eternity.</p>

<p>The polypes may be as it were grafted together. If the truncated
portions of a polype be placed end to end, and then pushed
together with a gentle force, they will unite, and form a single
one. The union is at first made by a fine thread, and the portions<span class="pagenum" id="Page384">[384]</span>
are distinguished by a narrow neck, which gradually fills up and
disappears, the food passing from one portion to another. Portions
not only of the same, but pieces of different polypes may be
thus united together. You may fix the head of one polype to
the trunk of another; and that which is thus produced, will
grow, eat, and multiply like another.</p>

<p>There is still another method of uniting these animals together,
more wonderful in its nature, and less analogous to any known
principles of animation, and more difficult to perform. It is
effected by introducing one within the other, forcing the body of
one into the mouth of the other, and pushing it down so that their
heads may be brought together: in this state it must be kept for
some time; the two individuals are at last united, and grafted
into each other; and the polype, which was at first double, is
converted into one, with a great number of arms, and performs
all its functions like another.</p>

<p>The hydra fusca furnishes us with another prodigy, to which
we know nothing that is similar either in the animal or vegetable
kingdom. They may be turned inside out like a glove, and, notwithstanding
the apparent improbability of the circumstance,
they live and act as before. The lining or coating of the stomach
now forms the epidermis, and the former epidermis now constitutes
the coating of the stomach. A polype thus turned, may
often have young ones attached to its side. If this be the case,
after the operation they are of course inclosed in the stomach.
Those which have acquired a certain size extend themselves towards
the mouth, that they may get out when separated from
the body; those which are but little grown, turn themselves inside
out, and by these means place themselves again on the outside
of the parent polype.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page385">[385]</span></p>

<p>The polype thus turned combines itself a thousand different
ways. The fore-part often closes itself, and becomes a supernumerary
tail. The polype which was at first straight, now bends
itself, so that the two tails resemble the legs of a pair of compasses,
which it can open and shut. The old mouth is at the joint
as it were of the compasses; it cannot, however, act as one, so
that a new one is formed near it, and in a little time a new species
of hydra is formed with several mouths.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate23B">Plate XXIII. B.</a> Fig. 18, represents the upper part of a polype
that has been divided into two parts; a, the upper, c, the lower
part, the end c being something larger than that of a common
polype, and is sensibly perforated; in the summer time this part
often walks and eats the same day it is cut. Fig. 17, the other
part of the same polype; the anterior end is very open, and the
edges of it turned a little outwards, which afterwards folding inwards,
close the aperture. This end now appears swelled, as at c,
Fig. 21; the arms shoot out from this end: at first three or four
points only begin to shoot, as at c, Fig. 20, and while these increase
in size, others appear between them; they can seize their
prey and eat before their arms have done growing. In the height
of summer the arms will often begin to shoot in twenty-four
hours; but in cold weather it will be fifteen or twenty days before
the head is formed. Fig. 22, represents a polype that was
cut close under the arms; this became also a complete animal in
a little time.</p>

<p>The sides of a polype that has been cut longitudinally, roll
themselves up in different ways, generally beginning at one of
the extremities, rolling itself up in a heap, as in <a href="#Plate23B">Plate XXIII. B.</a>
Fig. 19, with the outside of the skin inwards; it soon unrolls itself,
and the cut sides form themselves into a tube, whereof the
edges a b and e i, Fig. 15, on both sides meet each other and<span class="pagenum" id="Page386">[386]</span>
unite. Sometimes they begin to join at the tail end, at other
times the whole sides gradually approach each other. The sides
join so close, that from the first moment of their junction no scar
can be discovered. Fig. 14, represents a polype partly joined, as
at i b, the part c a e not yet closed. Fig. 29, represents a polype,
the heads of which have been repeatedly divided, by which means
it becomes literally a hydra. Fig. 24, represents a polype that
has been turned, endeavouring to turn itself back again, the skin
of the anterior part lying back upon the other; the arms varying
in their direction, being sometimes turned towards the head, see
Fig. 24 and 26, at others, towards the tail. The anterior extremity
c, formed by the edges of the reversed part a, remained
open for some days, and then began to close; new arms shot out
near the old ones, and several mouths were formed at those parts
where the arms joined the body. Fig. 23, 25, 27, 28, represent
the different changes that took place in another polype that had
been turned inside out, and the different revolutions it went
through before it acquired a fixed state; a c always shews the part
the polype had turned back, and a b the part it could not turn
back.</p>

<p>A polype, which has been partly turned back, remains but a
little time in that situation. Fig. 28, a, the part where the portion
it had turned back joined to the body a b; this became
straight, and formed a right angle with a b; the same day another
head appeared at e, and several arms, a o, a n, began to shoot
from the mouth a; at the other side of this mouth there were the
old arms a d. The next day the portion a c was drawn near the
body, and formed an acute angle with it, as at Fig. 25. Fig. 27,
represents the same swelled, after having swallowed a worm.
Four days afterwards its form had varied considerably, as may be
seen by comparing Fig. 25 and 28, having now one common
mouth, and two small polypes growing on it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page387">[387]</span></p>

<p>We may now be permitted to make a few reflections on this
singular animal. On considering the various properties that have
been already described, many particulars will be found in them
that are very analogous to others that are continually carrying on
around us; we perceive that there is a successive unfolding of
new parts. In every organized frame there is a continual effort
to extend its sphere of action, and enlarge the operation of that
portion of life which is communicated to it. This gradual evolution
requires a secret and curious mechanism, to regulate and
modify by re-action the continued conatus of the forming principle
within it. The polype is an organized whole, of which
each part, each molecule, each atom, tends to produce another;
it is, if we may so speak, one entire ovary, a compound of germ,
or seed. In cutting a polype to pieces, the nourishing juices,
which would have been employed in supporting the whole, are
made to act upon each portion.</p>

<p>When a polype is divided longitudinally, it forms two half
tubes; the opposite edges of these approach, and in a very short
time form a perfect tube. The sides are made to touch each
other by certain motions and contractions of the piece; but as
soon as the edges come in contact, a slight adhesion takes place,
the corresponding vessels unite, and new ones are unfolded, as in
a vegetable graft; by these means the points of connection and
cohesion are multiplied, the motion of the fluids is re-established,
and with them the vital &#339;conomy. This is performed with more
rapidity than in vegetables, because the polype is nearly gelatinous,
and its parts are extremely ductile; this ductility is supported
and preserved by the element which it inhabits. The
same reasoning applies equally to explain the formation of so
many heads to a polype, as constitute it a real hydra.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page388">[388]</span></p>

<p>A new polype is formed out of small portions or fragments, in
a very different manner, the operations in nature being always
varied, according as the circumstances differ; each fragment is
puffed up, the skin separated, and an empty space is formed
within it; this part is to become the stomach of the rising polype,
which soon sends forth arms, and is formed to the perfection proper
to its kind. We learn from this instance that the skin of the
polype is not so simple as was at first imagined; for we find it
dividing itself into two membranes, and forming thereby a cavity
fit to perform all the functions of a stomach; but why these
membranes are separated in the small portions, and not in the
larger, we cannot tell; but though we are ignorant of this, and
many more circumstances relative to the re-production of these
little animals, yet the foregoing facts enable us to understand
better the nature of the existence of these polypes which have
been turned inside out.</p>

<p>For as that part which formed the interior skin of the stomach
in the little fragments before-mentioned, became the exterior part
of the animal, the inside of the polype is consequently so similar to
the exterior skin, that one may be substituted for the other, without
injuring the vital functions; from hence we might, in some
measure, have inferred the possibility of the polypes living, after
they have been turned inside out, independent of the fact itself.</p>

<p>The viscera of the animal are situated in the thickness of the
skin, and absorbing pores are placed both on the inside and outside,
so that the animal can live whether the skin be turned one
way or the other. The Author of nature did not create the polype
to be turned as we turn a glove; but he formed an animal
whose viscera were lodged in the thickness of the skin, and with
powers to resist the various accidents to which it was unavoidably<span class="pagenum" id="Page389">[389]</span>
exposed by the nature of its life; and the organization necessary
for this purpose was so constructed, that the skin might be turned
without destroying life.</p>

<p>Every portion of a divided polype has, like the vegetable bud,
all the viscera necessary to its existence; it can, therefore, live
by itself, and push forth a head and tail, when placed end to end
against another piece. The vegetation consists in uniting the
portions, the vessels of each part increase in length, and a communication
is soon formed between them, which unites the whole.
The ease with which the parts unite, is as has been observed before,
probably owing to their gelatinous nature; for we find
many similar instances in tender substances. The solid parts of
the embryo, as the fingers, unite in the womb; tender fruit and
leaves may be also thus united.</p>

<p>A portion of these creatures is capable of devouring its prey
almost as soon as it is divided from the rest. In the structure of
those animals which are most familiar to us, a particular place is
appropriated for the developement and passage of the embryo.
But on the body of an animal, which, like a tree, is covered with
prolific gems, it is not surprizing that the young ones should proceed
from its sides, like branches from a tree. The mother and
her young ones form but one whole; she nourishes them, and
they contribute to her existence, as a tree supports, and is reciprocally
supported by its branches and leaves.</p>

<h4>OF THE HYDRA PALLENS.</h4>

<p>The hydra pallens has been fully described only by M. R&ouml;sel;<a href="#Footnote113" id="FNanchor113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
it is very seldom to be met with, is of a pale yellow colour, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page390">[390]</span>
grows smaller gradually from the bottom, the tail is somewhat
round or knobbed, the arms are about the length of the body, of
a white colour, and generally seven in number, apparently composed
of a chain of globules; it brings forth the young from all
parts of its body. Linn&aelig;us defines it as, hydra pallens tentaculis
subsenis mediocribus;<a href="#Footnote114" id="FNanchor114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Pallas as, hydra attenuata corpore flavescente,

<h4>OF THE HYDRA HYDATULA.</h4>

<p class="plateref"><a href="#Plate21">Plate XXI.</a> Fig. 1, 2, 3, and 4.</p>

<p>The next in order is the hydra hydatula, which we have already
defined from Linn&aelig;us as a hydra with four obsolete arms, and a
vesicular body: it is spoken of by several medical writers, who
are enumerated in the Systema Natur&aelig;, p. 1321. It is described
also by Hartman, Misc. Nat. Cur. Dec. I. An. 7, Obs. 206,
Dec. II. An. 4, Obs. 73, as hydatis animata; also in the Dissert.
de Inf. Viv. p. 50; n. 6, t&aelig;nia hydatoidea. Pallas defines it as
t&aelig;nia hydatigena rugis imbricata corpore postice bulla lymphatic&aelig;
terminato. The following description is extracted from that
in the Philosophical Transactions, No. 193, by Dr. Tyson, who
names it lumbricus hydropicus.</p>

<p>In the dissection of a gazella or antelope, Dr. Tyson observed
several hydatides or films filled with water, about the size of a
pigeon&#8217;s egg, and of an oval form, fastened to the omentum, and
some in the pelvis, between the bladder of urine and the rectum;
and he then suspected them to be a particular sort of insect, bred
in animal bodies, or at least the embryos or eggs of them: 1. Because<span class="pagenum" id="Page391">[391]</span>
he observed them included in a membrane, like a matrix,
so loosely, that by opening it with a finger or knife, the internal
bladder, containing the serum or lympha, seemed no where to
have any connection with it, but would very readily drop out,
still retaining its liquor, without spilling any of it. 2. He observed
that this internal bladder had a neck or white body, more
opake than the rest of the bladder, and protuberant from it, with
an orifice at its extremity, by which, as with a mouth, it exhausted
the serum from the external membrane, and so supplied
its bladder or stomach. 3. Upon bringing this neck near the
candle, it moved and shortened itself. Fig. 1, represents one of
these watery bladders inclosed in its external membrane, its shape
was nearly round, being only a little depressed or flatted, as a
drop of quicksilver will be by lying on a plane. In Fig. 2, the
neck is better seen; the external membrane being taken off, an
open orifice is found at its extremity; it consists of circular rings
or incisures, which are more visible when magnified, as in Fig. 3;
it then appears granulated with a number of little eminences all
over the surface; the orifice at the extremity seems to be formed
by retracting itself inwards, and upon trial it was found to be so;
for in Fig. 4, the neck of this polype is represented magnified and
drawn out its whole length; on opening it there were found
within the two strings a, a, which probably convey into the stomach
the moisture and nourishment, which the animal, by protruding
its neck, extracts from the external membrane.<a href="#Footnote116" id="FNanchor116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<h4>OF THE HYDRA STENTOREA.</h4>

<p class="plateref"><a href="#Plate22">Plate XXII.</a> Fig. 27 and 28.</p>

<p>Hydra tentaculis ciliaribus corpore infundibuliformi.</p>

<p>The arms of this hydra are rows of short hairs, the body trumpet-shaped.</p>

<p>This species of hydra is very common, and has been described
by almost every writer on these subjects; it is placed by M&uuml;ller
among the vorticell&aelig;.</p>

<p>Vorticella stentorea caudata, elongata, tub&aelig;formis limbo ciliato.
M&uuml;ller animalcula infusoria.</p>

<p>Mr. Baker originally named it the funnel-like polype, which
Messrs. Trembley and Reaumur changed to the tunnel-like polype,
under which name it appears in the Philosophical Transactions,
No. 474.</p>

<p>There are three kinds of them, which are of different colours,
green, blue, and white. The white ones are the most common.
It is necessary to observe them often, and in various attitudes, in
order to obtain a tolerable idea of their structure. They do not
form clusters, but adhere singly by their tail to whatever comes
in their way; their anterior end is wider than the posterior, and
being round, gives the animal somewhat of a funnel form, though
it is not completely circular, having a sort of slit or gap that interrupts
the circle. The edge of this opening is furnished with a
great number of fibrill&aelig;, which by their brisk and continual motions
excite a current of water; the small bodies that float or<span class="pagenum" id="Page393">[393]</span>
swim near this current, are forced by it into the mouth of the
little animal. Trembley says, that he has often seen a number
of very small animalcula fall one after another into the mouth,
some of which were afterwards let out again at another opening,
which he was not able to describe.</p>

<p>They can fashion their mouths into several different forms. If
any thing touch them, they shrink back and contract themselves.
They live independent of each other, swimming freely through
the water in search of their prey, and fix to any thing they meet
with.</p>

<p>These animals multiply by dividing themselves, not longitudinally,
nor transversely, but sloping and diagonal wise; the proceedings
in nature continually varying in every new form of life.
Of the two polypes produced by the division of one, the first has
the old head and a new tail; the other, the old tail and a new
head.</p>

<p>To make the description more clear, Trembley called that with
the old head the superior polype, that with the new head the
inferior one. The first particular that is observable in these polypes,
when they are going to divide, is the lips of the inferior
one; a transverse and oblique stripe indicates the part where it is
going to divide; the new lips are formed at about two-thirds of
the length of the polype, reckoning from the head; the division
is made in a sloping line, that goes about half way round the parent
animal; these lips are at first discerned by a slow motion,
which engages the attention of the observer. They then insensibly
approach each other and close, whereby a swelling is formed
on the side of the polype, which is soon found to be a new head.
When the swelling is considerably increased, the two polypes<span class="pagenum" id="Page394">[394]</span>
may be plainly distinguished. The superior one being now connected
with the inferior one only by its lower extremity, is soon
detached from it, and swims away to fix itself on some convenient
substance; the inferior one remains fastened to the place where
the original polype was fixed before the division.</p>

<p>From the various modes by which different species of polypes
are multiplied, we are led to form more exalted ideas of nature,
and to see that the little we discover is but an exceeding small
part of her contents; we learn also to be more cautious in reasoning
from analogy, and laying down the known for a model to
the unknown, because we find that the operations in nature are
varied ad infinitum.</p>

<p>The growth of the hydra fusca is very quick, but that of the
hydra stentorea is much more so. The progress of the f&#339;tus is
always more rapid than that of the infant and adult animal; but
in these organized atoms the evolution is so rapid, as to appear
almost like an immediate creation.</p>

<p>Fig. 28 represents the hydr&aelig; stentore&aelig;, or funnel-polypes, fixed
to the under side of a piece of some vegetable substance; they are
in this figure of their natural size.</p>

<p>Fig. 27, the same polypes magnified; the different forms they
assume are also seen here, sometimes short and thick, as at m m;
long, as at n; nearly globular, as at o; extended to the full size,
as at k; seen as contracted at i. The fibrill&aelig; or little hairs may
be seen in most of the attitudes except those of l.</p>

<h4>OF THE HYDRA SOCIALIS.</h4>

<p class="plateref"><a href="#Plate21">Plate XXI.</a> Fig. 11.</p>

<p>Hydra socialis mutica torosa rugosa.<a href="#Footnote117" id="FNanchor117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p id="Footnote117"><a href="#FNanchor117" class="label">[117]</a> Linn. Syst. Nat. p. 1321. No. 7.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Social hydra, bearded thick and wrinkled.</p>

<p>This species of hydra has been described by many writers. It
is the vorticella socialis of M&uuml;ller, who defines it as vort cella
caudata, aggregata, clavata; disco obliquo. M&uuml;ller Animalcula
Infusoria, p. 304. Pallas makes it a brachionus, Pall. Zooph. 53.</p>

<p>In Fig. 11, these animals are represented as considerably magnified;
they appear like a circle, surrounded with crowns, or ciliated
heads, tied by small thin tails to a common center, from
whence they advance towards the circumference, where they
turn like a wheel, with a great deal of vivacity and swiftness, till
they occasion a kind of whirlpool, which brings into its sphere
the proper food for the polype. When one of them has been in
motion for a time, it stops, and another begins; sometimes two
or three may be perceived in motion together. They are often
to be found separate, with the tail sticking in the mud. The
body contracts and dilates very much, so as sometimes to have
the appearance of a cudgel; at others, to assume almost a globular
form. The young polypes of this species have been sometimes
taken for the hydra stentorea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page396">[396]</span></p>

<h3>OF THE VORTICELL&AElig;.</h3>

<p>We now come to another division of these animals, to which
later writers have given the name of vorticell&aelig;; this term I shall
therefore adopt, being of opinion that it behoves every man to
maintain that order in scientific arrangement which is not inconsistent
with truth, except he can produce another arrangement
more expressive of the nature of the objects it is designed to discriminate;
a process requiring no small degree of attention.</p>

<p>The variety that may be observed in these minute animals confirms
a principle, which, the more it is inquired into, the more it
will be found to accord with the general operations in nature,
namely, that there is always a pre-existent principle of life necessary
to the organization both of animals and vegetables; that the
alimentary and other particles which are added to, or apparently
belong to them, produce nothing of themselves; they are incapable
of forming the least fibre, but they are able to become constituent
parts of one organical whole, together with the instruments
whereby the forming principle is manifested, and rendered capable
of acting upon certain orders of creatures.</p>

<h4>VORTICELLA.</h4>

<p>Animal calyce vasculoso; ore contractili ciliato, terminali.
Stirps fixa.</p>

<p>A small animal, with a vascular cup; the mouth is at one end
ciliated, and capable of being contracted, the stem fixed.</p>

<h5>VORTICELLA ANASTATICA.</h5>

<p class="plateref"><a href="#Plate21">Plate XXI.</a> Fig. 13, 14, 15, and 16*.</p>

<p>Vorticella anastatica, composita, floribus campanulatis, stirpe
multiflora rigescente.</p>

<p>Vorticella anastatica, compound, with bell-shaped flowers, and
a rigid stem.</p>

<p>Cluster polype, second species. Trembley, Philos. Trans.
vol. xliv. part. 2. p. 643.</p>

<p>These polypes form a group resembling a cluster, or more properly
an open flower; this flower or cluster is supported by a
stem, which is fixed by its lower extremity to some of the aquatic
plants or extraneous bodies that are found in the water; the
upper extremity forms itself into eight or nine lateral branches,
perfectly similar to each other; these have also subordinate
branches, whose collective form much resembles that of a leaf.
Every one of these assemblages is composed of one principal
branch or nerve, which makes with the main stem of the cluster
an angle somewhat greater than a right one; from both sides of
this nerve the smaller lateral branches proceed; these are shorter
the nearer their origin is to the principal branch.</p>

<p>At the extremity of the principal branch, and also of all the lateral
ones, there is a polype or vorticella. There are others on
both sides of the lateral twigs, but at different distances from
their extremity. These polypes are all exceeding small, and of a
bell-like figure; near their mouth a quick motion may be discerned,
though not with sufficient distinctness to convey an<span class="pagenum" id="Page398">[398]</span>
adequate idea of its cause; upon the branches of these clusters
are round bodies, which will be more particularly described presently.</p>

<p>Every cluster has eight or nine of these branches or leaves;
they do not all proceed from the same point, but the points from
whence they set out are not far asunder; each of these branches
is bent a little inwards, so that all of them taken together form a
kind of shallow cup. If the eye be placed right over the base of
this cup, the appearance of the whole eight or nine branches is
like unto that of a star, with so many rays proceeding from the
center. If the cluster be slightly touched, all the branches instantly
fold up, and form a small round mass. The stem which
supports the cluster contracts also at the same time, folding up
like a workman&#8217;s measuring rule, that consists of three or four
joints. This extraordinary assemblage constitutes one organized
whole, formed of a multitude of similar and particular ones. A
new species of society, in which all the individuals are members
of each other in the strictest sense, and all participate of the same
life.</p>

<p>A few days after one of these clusters is formed, small round
bodies or bulbs may be perceived to protrude in several places
from the body of the branch; these grow very fast, and arrive at
their greatest growth in two or three days. The bulbs detach
themselves from the branches out of which they spring, and go
away, swimming till they can settle upon some substance which
they meet with in the water, and to which they fix themselves
by a short pedicle; the bulbs are then round, only a little flatted
on the under side, the pedicle continues to lengthen gradually for
about twenty-four hours, during the same time the bulbs also
change their figure, and become nearly oval. There are in a
cluster but few of these bulbs, compared with the number of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page399">[399]</span>
vorticell&aelig;, neither do all the bulbs come out at the same time.
The bulb then divides lengthways into two smaller ones, but
which are still much larger than the vorticell&aelig; themselves. It is
not long before these are separated like the first, and thus form
four bulbs on the same stalk; these again divide themselves, and
form eight; which again subdivide, and consequently make sixteen.
They are all connected with the stalk by a proper pedicle,
but they are not all of an equal size; the largest continue to
divide, and the smallest begin to open, and take the bell-formed
shape. Trembley observed from one round bulb, in about twenty-four
hours, by repeated divisions, one-hundred and ten vorticell&aelig;
to be formed.</p>

<p>It has been asked with propriety, what plant or what animal
could have led us to expect an existence and mode of propagation
similar to that of the vorticella anastatica?</p>

<p>Fig. 13 represents one branch of the vorticella anastatica; on
this branch, besides the vorticell&aelig; which are of a bell-like form,
some of those round bodies from which they first spring, and by
which they are so remarkably distinguished from any other species,
may be seen.</p>

<p>Fig. 14 represents one of the globular bodies after it has parted
from the cluster, and has fixed itself to some other body, and
after the globule itself and its pedicle have begun to lengthen.</p>

<p>Fig. 15 represents the two bodies that were formed by the parting
of that which is shewn at Fig. 14.</p>

<p>Fig. 16* represents four that were formed by the separation of
the two bulbs, exhibited in the foregoing figure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page400">[400]</span></p>

<h5>VORTICELLA PYRARIA.</h5>

<p class="plateref"><a href="#Plate22">Plate XXII.</a> Fig. 25, 26.</p>

<p>Vorticella composita, floribus muticis obovatis; tentaculis bigeminis,
stirpe ramosa. Compound, with beardless oval florets,
two double arms, the stem branched.</p>

<p>It is somewhat of a pear shape, the base is pellucid, the top
truncated, the lateral arms, which are a pair on each side, cannot
be distinguished without some attention; they are sometimes to
be seen disengaged from the pedicle, and rolling swiftly in a
kind of circle.</p>

<h5>VORTICELLA CRAT&AElig;GARIA.</h5>

<p class="plateref"><a href="#Plate22">Plate XXII.</a> Fig. 40.</p>

<p>Vorticella composita, floribus muticis globosis; tentaculis binis,
stirpe ramosa. Compound, with globous naked florets, two tentacules,
and a branched stem.</p>

<p>These vorticell&aelig; are to be found in the month of April, both in
the mud, and upon the tail of the monoculus quadricornis; they
are generally heaped together in the manner in which they are
represented in the figure; they are of a spherical form, and united
to one common stalk. They are also often to be found without
any pedicle. The body is rather contracted; the aperture is circular,
and surrounded with a marked margin; it has two small
arms. With a deep magnifier, a vehement rotatory motion may
be seen. They sometimes separate from the community, and go<span class="pagenum" id="Page401">[401]</span>
forwards in a kind of spiral line, and then in a little time come
back again to the rest.</p>

<p>The figure represents a parcel of these vorticell&aelig; united together.</p>

<p>Among the other authorities for this animal, Linn&aelig;us refers
to Baker&#8217;s description of the mulberry insect, &#8220;Employment for
the Microscope,&#8221; p. 348, which, as it differs a little from the
preceding account, we shall insert here. That from which his
drawing was made, and which he has described, was found in a
ditch near Norwich; he called it the mulberry insect, from the
resemblance it bore to that fruit; though the protuberances that
stand out round it are more globular than those of a mulberry.
It is to be seen rolling about from one place to another, and is
probably a congeries of animalcula; they are to be met with in
different numbers of knobs or protuberances, some having fifty
or sixty, others more or less, down to four or five. The manner
of moving is the same in all. They are generally of a pale
yellow.</p>

<h5>VORTICELLA OPERCULARIA.</h5>

<p class="plateref"><a href="#Plate22">Plate XXII.</a> Fig. 29.</p>

<p>Vorticella composita floribus muticis ovalibus, stirpe ramosa.
Compound, with naked oval florets, and a branched stem.</p>

<p>These vorticell&aelig; are of a lemon shape, and are generally found
in clusters, branching out from a stem, which mostly adheres to
some convenient substance.</p>

<p>That species of them which is described by Baker had a very
short pedicle, and the animals were much longer than those which<span class="pagenum" id="Page402">[402]</span>
are represented at Fig. 29. There was no main stem, but all the
pedicles were joined in one center, round which the animals
extended themselves as so many radii, forming a very pleasing
figure.</p>

<p>The mouths of these animalcula are not ciliated, but they are
furnished with a round operculum or cover, connected by a long
ligament or muscle, which extends downwards through the body,
and is affixed withinside of it, near the tail. This ligament may
be contracted or dilated, so that the cover can be removed to
some distance from the mouth; in this situation several short
hairs maybe found to radiate from it; these have a vibratory
motion, by which they excite a current of water, most probably
to draw in the proper nourishment, after which they shut or pull
down the cover, which they again extend at pleasure: when the
cover is pulled close down, the mouth contracts, and no hairs
are to be seen.</p>

<p>Fig. 29 represents the vorticella opercularia; &#383;, the operculum
removed at some distance from the mouth, at t; it is nearly close
at r, the mouth contracted, the cover drawn in, and no hairs to
be seen; u, a part of the stalk, from which some of the animalcula
are separated.</p>

<h5>VORTICELLA UMBELLARIA.</h5>

<p class="plateref"><a href="#Plate22">Plate XXII.</a> Fig. 30.</p>

<p>Vorticella composita, floribus ciliatis globosis muticis, stirpe
umbellata. Compound, with ciliated globous naked florets and
an umbellated stem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page403">[403]</span></p>

<p>Vorticella acinosa, simplex, globosa, granis nigricantibus, pedunculo
rigido. M&uuml;ller Animal. Infus. p. 319.</p>

<p>We frequently find in divers places, upon water-plants, and other
bodies in the water, a whitish substance that looks like mould;
plants, pieces of wood, snail shells, &amp;c. are often entirely covered
over with this substance. If we examine any of these minute
bodies by the microscope, we shall find such motions as will induce
us to think them an assemblage of living animals, severally
fixed to the extremities of small stems or pedicles, many of which
are often so united as to form together a sort of branches or clusters,
from whence they have been termed clustering polypes, or
des polypes en bouquet.</p>

<p>These clusters are larger or smaller, according to the species of
the vorticell&aelig; which form them, as well as owing to the concurrence
of many other circumstances. To obtain a clear idea of the
figure of these animals, it is best to observe the smaller clusters,
as in the larger they are often rendered less distinct on account
of the number.</p>

<p>The length of those which are represented at Fig. 30, is about
the 240th of an inch; they are of a bell-shape. The anterior part
a c generally appears open, the posterior part is fixed to a stem
or pedicle, b e; it is by the extremity of this pedicle that the vorticella
fastens itself to any substance. It appears in the microscope
of a brownish colour, excepting at the smaller end b, where
it is transparent, as well as the whole pedicle b e. When the
anterior part a c is open, a very lively motion may be perceived
about its edges; and when it presents itself in a particular manner,
something very much resembling the little wheels of a mill,
moving with great velocity, may be discovered on both sides of
the edges of this anterior part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page404">[404]</span></p>

<p>These vorticell&aelig; are able to contract themselves suddenly.
They may be made to do this, either by touching them, or moving
the substance to which they are fixed. When they contract,
the edges of the anterior parts are drawn quite into the body;
on resuming their former posture, the edges may be seen to come
forth, and put themselves in motion as before. Minute substances
that float in the water are often forced down into these openings,
and sometimes are thrown out again.</p>

<p>They are capable of swimming about singly, but their form is
in that case considerably different from that which they have
when they are fixed. To see regularly in what manner the clusters
are formed, and in what way these little creatures multiply,
it is best to observe one that is fixed by itself.</p>

<p>The pedicle of a single vorticella is at first short, but it soon
grows longer, and then begins to multiply, that is, to divide or
split itself into two lengthways. To effect this, the lips are first
drawn into the body, the anterior part closes and becomes round,
and loses its bell shape, the motion about the lips ceases, though
a small degree of motion may be perceived within the body.
The anterior end flattens gradually, and spreads wider in proportion
as it grows smaller. It then gradually splits down the
middle, that is, from the middle of the head to the pedicle, so
that in a little time two separate round bodies appear to be joined
to the end of the pedicle that before supported but one.</p>

<p>The mouth or anterior part of each of these bodies now opens
by degrees; and in proportion as they open, the lips of the new
vorticella begin to display themselves. The motion before spoken
of may then also be perceived. Indeed it is the best time of observing
it; it is at first slow, but more rapid in proportion as the
mouth opens, when it is as swift as that of the vorticella before<span class="pagenum" id="Page405">[405]</span>
it began to divide, and we may now look upon it as completely
formed. A vorticella is generally about one hour in dividing
itself.</p>

<p>The lower of the three drawings, Fig. 30, represents two vorticell&aelig;
joined by their posterior extremity to one pedicle; soon
after the division, each vorticella begins to shew a pedicle of its
own.</p>

<p>Fig. 30 represents a cluster of eight vorticell&aelig;; by this figure
we may form some idea in what manner the pedicles are disposed
as their number increases. There were at first only two at b,
whose branches lengthened to d, and then each of them was divided
into two, now forming four; these again lengthened and
reached i; when they were again subdivided, as in the figure.</p>

<p>The reader will join with Bonnet in admiring the group of
wonders afforded by a single spot of mouldiness. What unforeseen,
varied, and interesting scenes are presented within so small
a compass! what a theatre is exhibited to a thinking mind! But
our abode is so recluse, that we have but a glimmering view of it:
how great would our astonishment be, if the whole spectacle was
disclosed to us at once, and we were enabled to penetrate into the
interior structure of this wonderful assemblage of living atoms!
Our eyes see only the gross parts of the decorations, whilst the
machines that execute them remain in impenetrable darkness!
Who shall enlighten this profound obscurity, or dive into an abyss
where reason is lost; or draw from thence the treasures of wisdom
concealed within it? Let us learn to be content with the
small portion that is communicated to us, and contemplate with
gratitude the first traces of human understanding that are imparted
to us in these discoveries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page406">[406]</span></p>

<h5>VORTICELLA BERBERINA.</h5>

<p>Vorticella composita, floribus ovalibus muticis, stirpe ramosa.
Compound, with oval beardless florets.</p>

<p>This is a species of the vorticell&aelig;, which resembles the preceding
one in many respects, particularly in being multiplied in the
same manner, that is, by dividing or splitting, according to its
length.</p>

<p>They are more slender than the vorticella umbellaria; the
branches of the clusters are transparent. When many of them
are together, they appear of a changeable violet colour; the clusters
are not unlike a sprig of spun glass. The motion of the lips
is not so easily distinguished as in the foregoing species, though
it may be observed in these whilst they are opening and completing
their formation. For at these times the motion is but slow,
whereas it becomes afterwards very quick in those that are arrived
at a state of perfection.</p>

<p>All the cluster vorticell&aelig; detach themselves from time to time
from the stem, and from these they swim about till they fix again
upon some convenient substance; the branches, when deserted,
bear no more vorticell&aelig;.</p>

<h5>VORTICELLA DIGITALIS.</h5>

<p class="plateref"><a href="#Plate22">Plate XXII.</a> Fig. 31.</p>

<p>Vorticella composita, floribus cylindricis, unisulcatis semiclausis,
stirpe ramosa. Compound, with cylindrical florets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page407">[407]</span></p>

<p>Vorticella composita, cylindrica, crystallina, apice truncata et
fissa, pedunculo fistuloso ramosa. M&uuml;ller Animal. Infus. p. 327.</p>

<p>This species of the vorticella is very scarce, it seems only to
have been seen by R&ouml;sel, who found it on the monoculus quadricornis,
till it was discovered in the year 1784 by M&uuml;ller, who
had sought for it several years before, but in vain.</p>

<p>The body is cylindrical, crystalline, and appears almost empty;
it has three pellucid points disposed lengthways, the apex is truncated
in an oblique direction, the margin bent back. The upper
part contracts itself, and the margin then assumes a conical shape,
with a convex surface; there are in general but few branches
from the principal stem, and these are short and thick. It excites
an undulatory motion, but no hairs, nor any rotatory motion,
have been discovered. Fig. 31, o and n, represents the vorticella
adhering to the monoculus quadricornis.</p>

<h5>VORTICELLA CONVALLARIA.</h5>

<p class="plateref"><a href="#Plate22">Plate XXII.</a> Fig. 39.</p>

<p>Vorticella simplex, gregaria, flore campanulata mutico; tentaculis
bigeminis, stirpe fixa. Simple, but gregarious, the florets
bell-shaped, with two pair of little arms, and a fixed stem.</p>

<p>Vorticella simplex, campanulata, pedunculo rotortili. M&uuml;ller
Animal. Infus.</p>

<p>These vorticell&aelig;, or bell-animals, as they are termed by Baker,
are generally found adhering to some substance in the water;
they are represented here as found by R&ouml;sel, fixed to a curious<span class="pagenum" id="Page408">[408]</span>
cornu ammonis, with points projecting from the back. To the
naked eye they appear only as so many little white points, but
under the microscope, as little bells, agitating the water to a
considerable distance. The stems of these have a particular motion,
they draw themselves up and shorten all at once, taking the
form of a spiral wire or screw; in a moment after they again resume
their former shape, stretching themselves out straight as
before. Many of them may be seen at times adhering to each
other by their tails; the cilia, which are two on each side of the
mouths, are very seldom to be perceived.</p>

<h5>VORTICELLA URCEOLARIS.</h5>

<p class="plateref"><a href="#Plate22">Plate XXII.</a> Fig. 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38.</p>

<p>Vorticella simplex, pedunculata, ore dentato. Single, with a
short tail, and toothed mouth.</p>

<p>Brachionus capsularis testa ovata apice sexdentata basi incisa,
cauda longa bicuspi. M&uuml;ller Animal. Infus. p. 356.</p>

<p>To the naked eye it appears as a white moveable point; but
when examined by the microscope, a tail projecting from the
lower part is discovered, and a double rotatory instrument is
seen, which it can conceal or expose at pleasure. It has been
seen and described by most microscopical writers; but as Baker&#8217;s
seems to be the most perfect description, I shall principally follow
his account of it.</p>

<p>He discovered three species of them, two of which are included
under the vorticella urceolaris. Fig. 33, 34, 35, are of the first
species; Fig. 36, 37, 38, are of the second kind. The first sort,<span class="pagenum" id="Page409">[409]</span>
when extended, is about twice as long as it is broad. It is contained
in a shell; the fore part of this is armed with four sharp
teeth or points; the opposite side has no teeth, but is waved or
bent in two places, like the form of a Turkish bow. At the
bottom there is a hole, through which it pushes the tail. It fastens
itself by this tail to any convenient substance when it intends
to use its rotatory organs; but when it is floating in the water,
and at all other times when not adhering to any body, it wags
the tail backwards and forwards something like a dog.</p>

<p>We may consider it as divided into a head, thorax, and abdomen;
each of which may be extended and contracted considerably:
it can, by dilating all three, protrude the head beyond the
shell, or by contracting them, draw the whole body within the
same.</p>

<p>The head, when extended, divides itself into two branches, between
which, another part, a kind of proboscis, is pushed out;
at the end of this are two fibrils, that appear when they are at
rest like a broad point, but which can be moved to and from
each other very briskly with a vibratory motion, see Fig. 33.</p>

<p>The form and situation of the two branches are sometimes
changed, the ends thereof becoming more round, and the vibratory
motion is altered to a rotatory one: this alteration is represented
at Fig. 34: the head also appears in this figure. The thorax
is annexed to the lower part of the head; it is muscular:
within it there is a moving intestine, which has been supposed to
be either the lungs or the heart of the little creature, see b,
Fig. 33 and 34.</p>

<p>A communication is formed between the thorax and the abdomen
by means of a short vessel c, whose alternate contractions<span class="pagenum" id="Page410">[410]</span>
and dilatations occasion the abdomen to rise and fall alternately,
having at the same time a sort of peristaltic motion. The food
is conveyed through this vessel into the abdomen, where it is
digested; it is then discharged by the anus, which is placed near
the tail.</p>

<p>The tail has three joints, and is cleft or divided at the extremity,
by which means it can better fasten itself to suitable objects.
It is in general projected from the lower end of the shell,
moving nimbly to and fro, serving the animal as a rudder when
it is swimming, to direct its course.</p>

<p>When the water in which the little animal is placed is nearly
dried away, or when it has a mind to compose itself to rest, it
contracts the head and fore-part of the body, brings them down
into the shell, and pulls the tail upwards, so that the whole
of this minute creature is contained within the shell, see Fig. 35.
The shell is so transparent that the terminations cannot be easily
distinguished when the animal is extended; but whatever is
transacted within the shell, is as plain as if there was no substance
between the eye and the interior parts.</p>

<p>Fig. 36, 37, 38, exhibit the appearance of another species of
these animals, which differs from the foregoing kind. This has
also a head, a thorax, and abdomen, but then they are not separated
by a gut or intermediate vessel, as in the former, but are
joined immediately together, and at the place where in the first
kind a moveable intestine was seen; in this a muscle, most probably
the heart, may be discovered; it has a regular systole and
diastole: this part is intended to be shewn at a, Fig. 36, 37, 38.
Like the other, it draws the head and tail within the shell, which
then appears to have six teeth or spikes on one side, and two on
the other. It very seldom protrudes its head so far out as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page411">[411]</span>
other; sometimes the fibrill&aelig; may be seen within the margin of
the shell.</p>

<p>Both species carry their young in an oval integument or bag,
fastened externally to the lower part of the shell, somewhere
about the tail; these bags are sometimes opake at one end, and
seemingly empty at the other, see d, Fig. 34: sometimes the
middle is opake, with a transparent margin, see b, Fig. 36.</p>

<p>It is highly entertaining to see a young one burst its integument,
and gradually force its way out; in performing this operation,
it is much assisted by the motion of the tail of the parent.
The head part comes out first, it then sets its rotatory organ in
motion, by which it is completely disengaged, leaving the integument
behind, which the vorticella freed itself from by repeated
strokes with its tail. A young one almost disengaged is seen at b,
Fig. 38; another embryo, c, was left adhering to the shell.</p>

<p>There are four more species of the vorticell&aelig; mentioned by
Linn&aelig;us, which are, the vorticella encrinus, the vorticella polypina,
the vorticella stellata, and the vorticella ovifera; which,
being marine animals, do not come properly within our plan.
The vorticella polypina will be described hereafter.</p>

<h5>TUBULARIA CAMPANULATA.</h5>

<p class="plateref"><a href="#Plate22">Plate XXII.</a> Fig. 32.</p>

<p>Tubularia reptans, tubis campanulatis. Creeping, with campanulated
tubes.</p>

<p>It is called by Baker the bell-flowered, or plumed animal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page412">[412]</span></p>

<p>These little creatures dwell in colonies together, from ten to
fifteen in number, living in a kind of slimy mucilaginous case,
which, when expanded in the water, has some resemblance to a
bell with its mouth upwards. These bells or colonies are to be
found adhering to the large leaves of duck-weed and other aquatic
plants.</p>

<p>The bell or case which these animals inhabit, being very transparent,
all the motions of its inhabitants may be discerned distinctly
through it. There are several ramifications or smaller
bells proceeding from the larger one; in each of these there is an
inhabitant. The opening at the top of these bells is just large
enough for the creature&#8217;s head, and a small part of its body to be
thrust out from it, the rest remaining in the case, into which it
also draws the head on the least alarm.</p>

<p>Besides the particular and separate motions which each of these
creatures is able to exert within its case, and independent of the
rest, the whole colony has a power of altering the position of the
bell, and removing it from one place to another. These animalcula
seem not to like to dwell in societies, whose number exceeds
fifteen; when the colony happens to increase in number, the bell
may be observed to split gradually, beginning from about the
middle of the upper extremity, and proceeding downwards towards
the bottom, till they at last separate and become two colonies,
independent of each other.</p>

<p>The arms are very near each other; sixty may often be counted
in one plume, having each the figure of an Italic <i>&#643;</i>, one of whose
hooked ends is fastened to the head; and altogether, when expanded,
compose a figure somewhat like a horseshoe, convex on
the side next the body, but gradually opening and turning outwards,
so as to leave a considerable distance within the outer extremities
of the arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page413">[413]</span></p>

<p>The plumed polype is of a very voracious disposition, devouring
a great number of small animals. If the arms, when extended,
be observed attentively with the microscope, they will be
found to have a constant vibratory motion; alternately bending
withinside of the plume, and then rising up again. When one
arm ceases its motion, the same is performed by another; thus by
the perpetual agitation of the several arms, such a strong current
is produced in the water, as brings the animalcula, and other minute
bodies, that are floating near the polype, into its mouth,
which is situated between the arms. The food, if agreeable to
the creature, is swallowed; if otherwise, it is rejected by a contrary
motion.</p>

<p>The animal may be seen very plain when it has retired within
the tube. The body is about one-eighth of an inch long, without
reckoning the plume, which is about the same length. It is cylindrical,
and the skin is very transparent. The plume is only a continuation
of this transparent skin, it is very broad in proportion to
the body, and of a remarkable figure; the base is of the shape of a
horseshoe; from this base the arms project, they bend rather outwards.
The plume which they form, gives them a resemblance
to some flowers. The arms may be compared, from their fineness
and transparency, to very fine threads of glass. The base of the
plume is grooved, and is fixed to the animal by the middle of the
horseshoe which it forms, and it is here that there is an opening
which serves as a mouth to the animal. The intestines are easily
distinguished through its transparent skin; when it has just been
eating, they are of a deep brown colour. Three principal parts
are very visible, the oesophagus, the stomach, and the rectum.</p>

<p>In the inside of these animals a small oblong whitish body is
formed, which is carried to the outside, and remains fixed in a
perpendicular direction to the body; many of these are formed<span class="pagenum" id="Page414">[414]</span>
daily, and of these oval bodies new animals are produced, exactly
similar to the parent.</p>

<p>If these minute bodies be eggs, they are of a singular kind,
being destitute of any covering, and are neither membranaceous
nor crustaceous; we cannot with propriety say the young ones
are hatched from them; we can, however, perceive these oviform
bodies to unfold themselves gradually. The developement is
accomplished in a few minutes, and an animalculum appears like
the parent.</p>

<p>Trembley amassed a great number of these eggs, and carried
them from England with him, keeping them quite dry; on putting
them into water, they gradually developed, and became as
perfect as the tubularia from which they proceeded.</p>

<p>There is a very great similarity in the construction of this little
creature and many of the marine polypes, who, like it, exist in
tubes of the same growth with themselves.</p>

<h2><span class="chapno">CHAP. VIII.</span><br />
<span class="chapname">OF THE ANIMALCULA INFUSORIA.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="startcapital">O</span>ur knowledge of the microscopic world is at present very
contracted, but we know enough to give us high conceptions of
its concealed wonders, and to fill us with profound astonishment
at the infinite variety of forms that are made recipient of life.
A few of the inhabitants of this minute world have been discovered.
The figure and apparent habits of life of these, resemble
so little those with which we are more acquainted, that it is
often difficult to find terms to express what is represented to the
eye.</p>

<p>Animalculum signifies a little animal, and therefore the term
might be applied to every animal which is considerably inferior
in size to ourselves. It has been customary, however, to distinguish
by the name of animalcula only such animals as are of a
size so diminutive, that their true figure cannot be discerned
without the assistance of glasses; and more especially it is applied
to such as are altogether invisible to the naked eye, and cannot
even be perceived to exist, but by the aid of microscopes.</p>

<p>By the help of magnifying glasses we are brought into a kind
of new world; and numberless animals are discovered, which,<span class="pagenum" id="Page416">[416]</span>
from their minuteness, must otherwise for ever have escaped our
observation: and how many kinds of these invisibles there may
be, is yet unknown; as they are observed of all sizes, from those
which are barely invisible to the naked eye, to such as resist the
action of the microscope, as the fixed stars do that of the telescope,
and with the best magnifiers hitherto invented, appear only
as so many moving points.</p>

<p>The smallest living creatures our instruments can shew, are
those that inhabit the waters; for, though possibly animalcula
equally minute, or perhaps more so, may fly in the air, or creep
upon the earth, it is scarce possible to obtain a view of them;
whereas, water being transparent, and confining the creatures
within it, we are enabled, by applying a drop of it to our glasses,
to discover with ease a great part of its contents, and in a space
barely visible to the naked eye, often perceive a thousand little
creatures, all full of life and vigour.</p>

<p>By the animalcula infusoria are meant, not the larv&aelig; of those
insects which in their first state are inhabitants of water, and
afterwards become winged insects, as the gnat, &amp;c. Baker, and
many other writers on the subject, have often confounded these,
and hence entered into a train of reasoning contrary to fact and
experience. The animalcula infusoria take their name from their
being found in all kinds either of vegetable or animal infusions;
if seeds, herbs, or other vegetable substances, be infused in water,
it will soon be filled with an indefinite number of these minute
beings. There is a prodigious variety in their forms; some perfectly
resemble the bell-polype; others are round or oblong,
without any, at least apparent, members; some resemble a bulb
with a long taper tail; some are nearly spherical; the greater part
are vesicular and transparent. Those most generally found in
every drop of ditch water are mere inflated bladders, with a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page417">[417]</span>
trace of intestines in the center; the next are a flat kind, with a
number of legs under the belly.</p>

<p>Motion seems to be their great delight; they pervade with
equal ease and rapidity, and in all forms and directions, the whole
dimensions of the drop, in which they find ample space for their
various progressions, sometimes darting straight forward, at other
times moving obliquely, then again circularly: they know how
to avoid with dexterity any obstacles that might obstruct their
progress. Hundreds may be seen in a drop of water in constant
action, yet never striking against each other. If at any time the
clusters prove so thick as to impede any of their motions, they
roll and tumble themselves over head, creep under the whole
range, force their way through the midst, or wheel round the
cluster, with surprizing swiftness; sometimes they will suddenly
change the direction in which they are moving, and take one diametrically
opposite thereto. By inclining the glass on which the
drop of water is laid, it may be made to move in any direction;
the animalcula in the drop will swim as easily against the stream
as with it.</p>

<p>If the water begin to evaporate, and the drop to grow smaller,
they flock impetuously towards the remaining part of the fluid;
an anxious desire of attaining this momentary respite of life is
very visible, as well as an uncommon agitation of the organs by
which they imbibe the water. These motions grow more languid
as the water fails, till at last they entirely cease.</p>

<p>Animalcula and insects will support a great degree of cold, but
both one and the other perish when it is carried beyond a certain
point. The same degree of heat that destroys the existence of
insects, is fatal to animalcula; as there are animalcula produced<span class="pagenum" id="Page418">[418]</span>
in water at the freezing point, so there are insects which live in
snow.</p>

<p>If the smallest drop of urine be put into a drop of water
where these animalcula are roving about, apparently happy and
easy, they instantly fly to the other side, but the acid soon communicating
itself to this part, their struggles to escape are increased,
but the evil also increasing, they are thrown into convulsions,
and soon expire.</p>

<p>Among animalcula, as in every other part of nature, there is
constantly a certain proportion preserved between the size of the
individuals and their number. There are always fewest amongst
the larger kinds, but they increase in number as they diminish in
size, till of the last, or lowest to which our powers of magnifying
will reach, there are myriads to one of the larger. Like other
animals, they increase in size from their birth till they have attained
their full growth. When deprived of food, they grow
thin and perish; and different degrees of organization are to be
discovered in their structure.</p>

<p>The birth and propagation of these microscopic beings is as
regular as that of the largest animals of our globe; for though
their extreme minuteness prevents us, in most cases, from seeing
the germ from which they spring, yet we are well assured, from
numerous observations, that the manner in which they multiply
is regulated by constant and invariable laws.</p>

<p>It has been shewn that different species of the hydr&aelig; and vorticell&aelig;
multiply and increase by natural divisions and subdivisions
of the parent&#8217;s body; this manner of propagation is very common
among the animalcula in infusions, though with many remarkable<span class="pagenum" id="Page419">[419]</span>
varieties. Some multiply by a transverse division, a contraction
takes place in the middle, forming a kind of neck that becomes
smaller every instant, till they are enabled by a slight
degree of motion to separate from each other. These animalcula
in general studiously avoid each other; but when they are in the
labour of multiplication, and the division is in great forwardness,
it is not uncommon to see one of them precipitate itself on the
neck of the dividing animalculum, and thus accelerate the separation.</p>

<p>Another species, when it is on the point of multiplying, fixes
itself to the bottom of the infusion; it then forms an oblong
figure, afterwards becomes round, and begins to turn rapidly, as
if upon an internal center, continually changing the direction of
its rotatory motion; after some time, we may perceive two lines
on the spherule, forming a kind of cross; soon after which the
animalculum divides into four distinct beings, which grow, and
are again subdivided.</p>

<p>Some multiply by a longitudinal division, which in one kind
begins in the fore-part, and others in the hind-part; from another
kind a small fragment is seen to detach itself, which very soon
acquires the form of the parent animalculum. Lastly, some propagate
in the same manner as those we deem more perfect
animals.</p>

<p>From what has been said, it appears clearly that their motions
are not purely mechanical, but are produced by an internal spontaneous
principle, and that they must therefore be placed among
the class of living animals, for they possess the strongest marks,
and the most decided characters of animation; and consequently,
that there is no foundation for the supposition of a chaotic and<span class="pagenum" id="Page420">[420]</span>
neutral kingdom, which can only have derived its origin from a
very transient and superficial view of these animalcula.</p>

<p>It may also be further observed, that as we see the motions of the
limbs, &amp;c. of the more noble animals, viz. the human species, are
produced by the mechanical construction of the body and the action
of the soul thereon, and are forced by the ocular demonstration arising
from anatomical dissection, to acknowledge this mechanism
which is adapted to produce the various motions necessary to the
animal; and as when we have recourse to the microscope, we find
those pieces which had appeared to the naked eye as the primary
mechanical causes of the particular motions, to consist themselves
of lesser parts, which are the causes of motion, extension, &amp;c. in
the larger; when the structure can therefore be traced no further
by the eye or glasses, we have no right to conclude, that the
parts which are invisible, are not equally the subject of mechanism:
for this would be only to assert in other words, that a thing
may exist because we see and feel it, and has no existence when
it is not the object of our senses.</p>

<p>The same train of reasoning may be applied to microscopic insects
and animalcula; we see them move, but because the muscles
and members which occasion these motions are invisible,
shall we infer that they have not muscles, with organs appropriated
to the motion of the whole and its parts? To say that they
exist not, because we cannot perceive them, would surely not be
a rational conclusion. Our senses are indeed given us, that we
may comprehend some effects; but then we have also a mind
with reason bestowed upon us, that from the things which we do
perceive with our senses, we may deduce the nature of those
causes and effects which are imperceptible to the corporeal
eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page421">[421]</span></p>

<p>Messrs. Buffon, Needham, and Baron M&uuml;nchhausen, have considered
this part of animated nature in so different a light from
other writers, that we cannot with propriety entirely pass them
over. Needham imagined that there was a vegetative force in
every microscopical point of water, and every visible filament of
which the whole vegetable contexture consists; that the several
species of microscopic animals may subside, resolve again into
gelatinous filaments, and again give lesser animals, and so on, till
they can be no further pursued by glasses. That agreeable to this
idea, every animal or vegetable substance advances as fast as it
can in its revolution, to return by a slow descent to one common
principle, whence its atoms may return again, and ascend to a
new life. That notwithstanding this, the specific seed of one
animal can never give another of a different species, on account
of the preparation it must receive to constitute it this specific
seed.</p>

<p>Buffon asserts, that what have been called spermatic animals,
are not creatures really possessing life, but something proper to
compose a living creature, distinguishing them by the name of
organic particles, and that the moving bodies which are to be
found in the infusions either of animal or vegetable substances,
are of the same nature.</p>

<p>Baron M&uuml;nchhausen supposed that the seeds of mushrooms
were first animals, and then vegetables; and this, because he had
observed some of the globules in the infusions of mushrooms,
after moving some time, to begin to vegetate.</p>

<p>It might be sufficient in the first instance to observe, that
Messrs. Needham, and Buffon, by having recourse to a vegetative
force and organic particles, to account for the existence and explain
the nature of animalcula, and the difficulties of generation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page422">[422]</span>
have substituted words in the place of things; and that we are no
gainers by the substitution, unless they explain the nature of
these powers. But to this we may add, that all those who have
examined the subject with accuracy and attention, as Bonnet,
De Saussure, Baker, Wrisberg, Spalanzani, Haller, Ellis, M&uuml;ller,
Lederm&uuml;ller, Corti, Rofredi, &amp;c. disagree with the foregoing
gentlemen, proving that they had deceived themselves by inaccurate
experiments, and that one of them, Buffon, had not seen the
spermatic animals he supposed himself to be describing, insomuch
that Needham was at last induced to give up his favourite hypothesis.</p>

<p>Though we can by no means pretend to account for the appearance
of most animalcula, yet we cannot help observing, that
our ignorance of the cause of any ph&aelig;nomenon is no argument
against its existence. Though we are not, for instance, able to
account in a satisfactory manner for the origin of the native Americans,
yet we suppose Buffon himself would reckon it absurd to
maintain, that the Spaniards on their arrival there found only
<span class="smcapall">ORGANIC PARTICLES</span> moving about in disorder. The case is the
very same with the eels in paste, to whose animation he objects.
They are exceedingly small in comparison with us; but, with the
solar microscope, Baker has made them assume a more respectable
appearance, so as to have a diameter of an inch and an half, and
a proportionable length. They swam up and down very briskly;
the motion of their intestines was very visible; when the water
dried up they died with apparent agonies, and their mouths
opened very wide. Now, were we to find a creature of the size
of this magnified eel gasping in a place where water had lately
been, we certainly should never conclude it to be merely an
<span class="smcapall">ORGANIC PARTICLE</span>, or fortuitous assemblage of them, but a fish.
Why then should we conclude otherwise with regard to the eel
in its natural state, than that it is a little fish? In reasoning on<span class="pagenum" id="Page423">[423]</span>
this subject, we ought ever to remember, that however essential
the distinction of bodies into great and small may appear to us,
they are not so to the Deity, with whom, as Baker well expresses
himself, &#8220;an atom is a world, and a world but as an atom.&#8221; Were
the Deity to exert his power a little, and give a natural philosopher
a view of a quantity of paste filled with eels, from each of
whose bodies the light was reflected as in the solar microscope;
our philosopher, instead of imagining them to be mere organic
particles, as the paste would appear like a little mountain, he
would probably look upon the whole as an assemblage of serpents,
and be afraid to come near them. Whenever, therefore,
we discover beings to appearance endued with a principle of self-preservation,
or whatever we make the characteristic of animals,
neither the smallness of their size, nor the impossibility of our
knowing how they came there, ought to cause us to doubt of
their being animated.</p>

<p>I shall here insert some extracts of the experiments made by
Ellis at the desire of Linn&aelig;us, and which are a full refutation of
those made by Needham and M&uuml;nchhausen. By those he made
on the infusions of mushrooms in water, it appeared evidently
that the seeds were put in motion by minute animals, which
arose on the decomposition of the mushroom; these, by pecking
at the seeds, which are little round reddish bodies, moved them
about with great agility in a variety of directions, while the little
animals themselves were scarce visible till the food they had eaten
discovered them.</p>

<p>The ramified filaments, and jointed or coralloid bodies, which
the microscope discovers to us on the surface of most vegetable
and animal infusions, when they become putrid, and which were
supposed by Needham to be zoophytes, were found by Ellis to be
of that genus of fungi called mucor, many of which have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page424">[424]</span>
figured by Michelius, and described by Linn&aelig;us. Their vegetation
is so quick, that they may be seen to grow and seed under
the eye of the observer. Other instances of similar mistakes in
Needham&#8217;s experiments may be seen in Ellis&#8217;s paper, Philos.
Trans. vol. lix. p. 138.</p>

<p>A species of mucor arises also from the bodies of insects putrefying
in water; this species sends forth a mass of transparent
filamentous roots, from whence arise hollow seed vessels; on the
top there is a hole, from which minute globules often issue in
abundance, and with considerable elastic force, which move about
in the water. It will however be found, with a little attention,
that the water is full of very minute animalcula, which attack
these seeds, and thus prolong their motion; but after a small
space of time they rise to the surface, and remain there without
any motion; a fresh quantity rises up, and floating to the edge of
the water, remains there inactive; but no appearance can be
observed of detached and separated parts becoming what are
called microscopic animalcula. Indeed, it is surprizing that
Needham should ever take the filaments of the moistened grains
for any thing else than a vegetable production, a true species of
mouldiness.</p>

<p>On the 25th of May, Fahrenheit&#8217;s thermometer 70&deg;, Ellis
boiled a potatoe in the New River water, till it was reduced to
a mealy consistence. He put part of it, with an equal proportion
of the boiling liquor, into a cylindrical glass vessel, that held
something less than half a wine pint, and covered it close immediately
with a glass cover. At the same time he sliced an unboiled
potatoe, and, as near as he could judge, put the same
quantity into a glass vessel of the same kind, with the same proportion
of New River water not boiled, and covering it with
a glass cover, placed both vessels close to each other. On the<span class="pagenum" id="Page425">[425]</span>
26th of May, twenty-four hours afterwards, he examined a small
drop of each by the first magnifier of Wilson&#8217;s microscope, whose
focal distance is reckoned at <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>50</sub> part of an inch; and, to his amazement,
they were both full of animalcula of a linear shape, very
distinguishable, moving to and fro with great celerity; so that
there appeared to be more particles of animal than vegetable life
in each drop. This experiment he repeatedly tried, and always
found it to succeed in proportion to the heat of the circumambient
air; so that even in winter, if the liquors be kept properly
warm, at least in two or three days the experiment will succeed.</p>

<p>The animalcula are infinitely smaller than spermatic animals,
and of a very different shape; the truth of which every accurate
observer will soon be convinced of, whose curiosity may lead
him to compare them, and he is persuaded they will find they are
no way akin. Having learnt from M. De Saussure, of Geneva,
that he found one kind of these animalcula infusoria that increases
by dividing across into nearly two equal parts, and that
the infusion was made from hemp-seed, he procured a quantity
of this seed, some of it he put into New River water, some into
distilled water, and some into very hard pump water; the result
was, that in proportion to the heat of the weather, or the warmth
in which they were kept, there was an appearance of millions of
minute animalcula in all the infusions; and some time after some
oval ones made their appearance; these were much larger than
the first, which still continued. These wriggled to and fro in an
undulatory motion, turning themselves round very quick all the
time that they moved forwards.</p>

<p>Ellis found out by mere accident a method to make their fins
appear very distinctly, especially in the larger kind of animalcula,
which are common to most vegetable infusions, such as the terebella.<span class="pagenum" id="Page426">[426]</span>
This has a longish body, with a cavity or groove at one
end, like a gimblet. By applying a small stalk of the horseshoe
geranium, the geranium zonale of Linn&aelig;us, fresh broken, to a
drop of water in which these animalcula are swimming, we shall
find that they will become instantly torpid, contracting themselves
into an oblong oval shape, with their fins extended like so
many bristles all round their bodies. The fins are in length about
half the diameter of the middle of their bodies. After lying in
this state of torpitude for two or three minutes, if a drop of
clean water be applied to them, they will recover their shape,
and swim about immediately, rendering their fins again invisible.
Before he discovered this expedient, he tried to kill them by
different kinds of salts and spirits; but though they were destroyed
by these means, their fins were so contracted, that he
could not distinguish them in the least.<a href="#Footnote118" id="FNanchor118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote118"><a href="#FNanchor118" class="label">[118]</a> The preceding recital
of the hypothesis of Messrs. Buffon, Needham, and Baron M&uuml;nchhausen,
may appear superfluous, having been so ably refuted by Mr. Ellis; the consideration,
however, that it may afford entertainment to some of my readers, and prove beneficial to others,
by cautioning them against too precipitately adopting plausible suppositions, induced me to
retain the account. <span class="smcap">Edit.</span></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>It is one of the wonders of the modern philosophy to have invented
means for bringing creatures so imperceptible as the various
animalcula under our cognizance and inspection. One
might well have deemed an object that was a thousand times too
little to be able to affect our sense, as perfectly removed from
human discovery; yet we have extended our sight over animals
to whom these would be mountains. The naked eye takes in
animal beings from the elephant to the mite; but below this,
commences a new order, reserved only for the microscope, which
comprehends all those from the mite, to those many millions of
times smaller; and this order cannot be said to be exhausted, if
the microscope be not arrived at its ultimate state of perfection.<span class="pagenum" id="Page427">[427]</span>
In reality, the greater number of microscopic animalcula are of so
small a magnitude, that through a lens, whose focal distance is
the tenth part of an inch, they only appear as so many points;
that is, their parts cannot be distinguished, so that they appear
from the vertex of that lens under an angle not exceeding the
minute of a degree. If we investigate the magnitude of such an
object, it will be found nearly equal to <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>100000</sub> of an inch long.
Supposing, therefore, these animalcula to be of a cubic figure,
that is, of the same length, breadth, and thickness, their magnitude
would be expressed by the cube of the fraction <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>100000</sub>, that
is, by the number <sup>27</sup>&#8260;<sub>1000000000000000</sub>, that is, each animalculum is
equal to so many parts of a square inch. This contemplation of
animalcula has rendered the idea of indefinitely small bodies very
familiar to us; a mite was formerly thought the limit of littleness,
but we are not now surprized to be told of animals many
millions of times smaller than a mite; for, &#8220;there are in some
liquors animalcules so small, as, upon calculation, the whole
magnitude of the earth is not found large enough to be a third
proportional to these minute floating animals and the whales in
the ocean.&#8221;<a href="#Footnote119" id="FNanchor119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> These considerations are still further heightened,
by reflecting on the internal structure of animalcula, for each
must have all the proportion, symmetry and adjustment of that
organized texture, which is indispensably necessary for the several
functions of life, and each must be furnished with proper organs,
tubes, &amp;c. for secreting the fluids, digesting its food, and propagating
its species.<a href="#Footnote120" id="FNanchor120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote120"><a href="#FNanchor120" class="label">[120]</a> Minute
animals proportionably exceed the larger kinds in strength, activity, and vivacity.
It has been already observed, <a href="#Page212">p. 212</a>, that the spring of a flea vastly outstrips any thing animals
of a greater magnitude are capable of; the motion of a mite is much quicker than that of the
swiftest race-horse. M. De L&#8217;Isle, Hist. Acad. Scienc. 1711. p. 23, has given the computation
of the velocity of a little creature, so small as to be scarcely visible, which he found to run three
inches in a second; supposing now its feet to be the fifteenth part of a line, it must make five-hundred
steps in the space of three inches, that is, it must shift its legs five-hundred times in a
second, or in the time of the ordinary pulsation of an artery. The rapidity with which many
of the water insects skim the surface of the fluid, and others swim in it, is astonishing, nor is
the celerity of the various species of animalcula infusoria less deserving of admiration. <span class="smcap">Edit.</span></p>

the arrangements of O. F. M&uuml;ller,<a href="#Footnote121" id="FNanchor121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> and giving the discriminating
characters by which he has distinguished them; abridging,
enlarging, or altering the descriptions, to render them in some

<p>Among the various animalcula which are discovered by the
microscope, this is the most minute, and the most simple; a small
jelly-like point, eluding the powers of the compound microscope,
and being but imperfectly seen by the single; these, and some
others of the mona kind, are so delicate and slender, that it is no
wonder they often escape the sight of many who have examined
infusions with attention; in a full light they totally disappear,
their thin and transparent forms blending as it were with the
water in which they swim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page431">[431]</span></p>

<p>Small drops of infused water are often so full of these, that it
is not easy to discover the least empty space, so that the water
itself appears changed into another substance less transparent,
but consisting of innumerable globular points, thick sown together;
which, though full of life, seem only a kind of inflated
bladders. In this a motion may be perceived, something similar
to that which is observed when the sun&#8217;s rays shine on the water,
the animalcula being violently agitated, or in a commotion like
unto a hive of bees. They are very common in ditch water, and
in almost all infusions, both of animal and vegetable substances.</p>

<p>This animalculum appears as a white point, which, when it is
highly magnified, is somewhat of an egg-shape; the smaller end
is generally marked with a black point; the situation of this is
sometimes varied, and found at the other end of the animalculum:
sometimes two black points are to be seen crossing the
middle of the body. It was found in sea water that had been

were no other animalcula in the same water.</p>

<p>This is among the number of the smaller animalcula, nearly of
a round figure, and so pellucid, that it is not possible to discover
the least vestige of intestines. Though they may often be seen
separate, yet they are more generally collected together, forming
a kind of vesicular or membranaceous mass. Contrary to the
custom of other animalcula, they seek the edges of the evaporating
water, the consequence of which is almost immediate death.
When the water is nearly evaporated, a few dark shades are perceived,
probably occasioned by the wrinkling of the body. A
slow tremulous motion, confined to one spot, may be perceived
at intervals; this in a little time becomes more lively, and soon
pervades the whole drop. Its motions are in general very quick:
two united together may sometimes be seen swimming among
the rest; while in this situation, they have been mistaken by some
writers for a different species, whereas it is the same generating
another by division. It is to be found in all water, though but
seldom in that which is pure; they are in great plenty in the
summer in ditch water, also in infusions of animal or vegetable
substances, made either of fresh or salt water, myriads being contained
in a drop; numbers of various sizes are to be found in the
filth of the teeth.<a href="#Footnote123" id="FNanchor123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote123"><a href="#FNanchor123" class="label">[123]</a> The circumstance
of animalcula being found in the teeth is mentioned with confidence by
various authors; some doubts may, however, still remain of the fact. Mr. Willughby detected
a woman, who pretended to take worms out of the teeth with a quill, having forced the
quill, from her just as she was putting it into his mouth, and found small worms in it; see
Birch&#8217;s History of the Royal Society, vol. iv. p. 387. I am inclined to think that the accounts
usually met with in authors have no better foundation. It has also repeatedly happened, that
ingenious men, from their anxiety for discovery, have imagined that objects have appeared to
their view, which, having related as facts, themselves or others have afterwards found to be nothing
more than a deceptio visus; and thus they have been, at least for a time, the unintentional
promulgators of error; considerable caution is therefore necessary on these occasions, see
<a href="#Page132">p. 132</a>, <a href="#Page133">133</a>.</p>

<p>Some authors, in support of a favourite system, have made bold assertions on the subject of
animalcula; the small-pox, the measles, the epilepsy, &amp;c. have been attributed to them: Langius
reduces all diseases in general to the same principle. A writer at Paris, who assumed the
title of an English physician, has proceeded still farther; he not only accounts for all diseases,
but for the operation of all medicines, from the hypothesis of animalcula. He has peculiar animals
for every disorder; scorbutic animalcula, podagrical animalcula, variolous animalcula, &amp;c.
all at his service. Journ. des Scav. tom. lxxxvii. p. 535, &amp;c.</p>

<p>It is not at all surprising that the wonderful discoveries relating to animalcula should have
been applied, however improperly, to support the most whimsical and chymerical systems.
Most of the discoveries in natural philosophy have been subjected to similar abuses, and laid
the foundation for the warm imaginations of some men to fabricate visionary theories; these
have been of great prejudice to real science, the primary object and ultimate reward of which is
the acquisition of truth. <span class="smcap">Edit.</span></p>

<p class="hinline">M. circulo notata. Mona, marked with a

<p>This lucid little point may be discovered with the third lens of
the common single microscope; when the magnifying power is
increased, it appears either of an oval or spherical figure, for it
assumes each of these at pleasure. It is transparent, and has a
small ellipse inscribed as it were within its circumference; this
ellipse is moveable, being sometimes in the middle, sometimes a
little towards the fore-part, at others, nearer the hind-part.
There is a considerable variety in its motions; it often turns
round for a long time in the same place; an appearance like two
kidneys may sometimes be perceived in the middle of the body,
and the animalculum is beautifully encompassed with a kind of
halo, arising most probably from invisible and vibrating fibrill&aelig;.
They are to be found in the purest waters.</p>

<p>These animated points seem to be nearly fixed to one spot,
where they have a fluctuating or reeling motion. They are frequently
surrounded with a halo, and differ in their figure, being
sometimes rather spherical, at others quadrangular. The black
margin is not always to be found, and sometimes one would almost
be tempted to think it had a tail. They are found in urine
which has been kept for a time. The urine is covered, after it
has remained in the vessel, with a dark-coloured pellicle or film,
in which these animals live: although the urine was preserved for
several months, no new animalcula were observed therein. It
has been already shewn, that a drop of urine is in general fatal to
other animalcula, yet we find in this instance, that there are animated
beings of a peculiar kind, appropriated to, and living in it.</p>

<p>Little spherical pellucid grains of different sizes, the circumference

<p>It is not easy to decide on the nature of these little assemblages
of corpuscles, which sometimes consist of four, at others of five,
and frequently of many more: the corpuscles are of different
sizes, according to the number assembled in one group. When
collected in a heap, the only motion they have is a kind of revolution
or rotatory one. The smaller particles separate from the
larger, often dividing into as many portions as there are constituent
particles in the group; when separated, they revolve with
incredible swiftness. To try whether this was a group of animalcula
collected together by chance, or whether this was their
natural state, the following experiment was made. A single corpuscle
was taken the moment it was separated from the heap, and
placed in a glass by itself; it soon increased in size, and when it
had attained nearly the same bulk as the group from which it was
separated, the surface began to assume a wrinkled appearance,
which gradually changed till it became exactly similar to the
parent group. This new-formed group was again decomposed,
like the preceding one, and in a little time the separated particles
became as large as that from which they proceeded. It is found
in a variety of infusions.</p>

<p>A very singular animalculum, appearing only as a grey mucous
mass; it is filled with a number of black globules of different
sizes, and is continually changing its figure. Being formed of a
gelatinous pellucid substance, the shape is easily altered, and it
pushes out branches of different lengths and breadths. The globules
which are within divide and pass immediately into the new
formed parts, always following the various changes of form in
the animalcula. The changes that are observed in the form of
this little creature, do not arise from any extraneous cause, but
are entirely dependent on its internal powers. It is to be met
with but very seldom; the indefatigable M&uuml;ller only saw it
twice, although he examined such an immense variety of infusions.
It is to be found in fenny situations.</p>

and the globules being all collected in the upper part, c,<span class="pagenum" id="Page437">[437]</span>
it next draws the pointed end up towards the middle of the

for some time, after which the lower part is swelled out as it is
represented in Fig. 4, d; the point a, is afterwards projected
from this ventricose part. It passes through five different forms
before it arrives at that which is seen, at Fig. 4. It scarcely
moves from one spot, only bending about sideways. It is to be
found in river water.</p>

in the dark part. It moves in a tremulous manner, and
often passes through the drop, turning round as if upon an axis.
Many may be often seen joined together in their passage through,
the water; they sometimes move as in a little whirlpool, and
then separate. They are found in great numbers on the surface

generally in the month of June, in marshy places; it moves but
slowly.</p>

<p>This globular animalculum is ten times larger than the monas

The intestines are just visible, and make the hinder part of the
body appear opake; it has commonly a slow fluttering kind of
motion, but if it be disturbed, the motion is more rapid. It is
found in most infusions of vegetables.</p>

<p>This is a small transparent animalculum; its intestines are immoveable,
of a green colour, and are placed near the middle of
the body, the edges often yellow; a small obtuse incision may be
discovered on the edge, which is, perhaps the mouth of the animalculum.
This little creature appears to be encompassed with
a kind of halo or circle. If this be occasioned by the vibratory
motion of any fringe of hairs, they are invisible to the eye, even
when assisted by the microscope. It seems to have a kind of
rotatory motion, at one time slow, at another quick; and is to be
found in water where the lemna minor, or least ducks-meat,
grows, sometimes as late as the month of December.</p>

<p>This is much smaller than the preceding, and is marked with
several circular lines; no motion is to be perceived among the
interior molecules. It sometimes moves about in a straight line,
sometimes its course is irregular, at others it keeps in the same

<p>When very much magnified this animalculum seems to have
some relation to the vorticella socialis, as seen with the naked
eye. It consists of crystalline molecules, disposed in a sphere,
and filling up the whole circumference; they are all of an equal
size. Whether they are included in a common membrane, or
whether they are united by one common stalk, as in the vorticella
socialis, has not been discovered. We are also ignorant of the
exact figure of the little particles of which it is composed; when
a very large magnifying power is used, some black points may be
discerned in the center of the crystalline molecules. The motion
is sometimes rotatory, sometimes from right to left, and the contrary.
It is found where the chara vulgaris has been kept.</p>

<p>Is a small roundish transparent body, composed of innumerable
molecules, homogeneous, pellucid, and of the shape of the moon
in its first quarter, without any common margin. It is in a continual
two-fold motion; the one, of the whole mass turning slowly
round; the other, of the molecules one among the other. They
are found in marshy places in the beginning of spring.</p>

<h5 class="inline" id="Infus21">21. <span class="smcap">Volvox Globator.</span></h5>

<p class="hinline">V. sph&aelig;ricus membranaceus. Spherical
membranaceous volvox.</p>

<p>This is a transparent globule, of a greenish colour; the f&#339;tus is
composed of smaller greenish globules. It becomes whiter and
brighter with age, moves slowly round its axis, and may be perceived
by the naked eye. But to the microscope the superficies
of this pellucid membrane appears covered with molecules, as if
it were granulated, which has occasioned some observers to imagine
it to be hairy; the round pellucid molecules that are fixed in
the center are generally largest in those that are young. The
exterior molecules may be wiped off, leaving the membrane
naked. When the young ones are of a proper size, the membrane
opens, and they pass through the fissure; after this the
mother melts away. They sometimes change their spherical
figure, the superficies being flattened in different places. Most
authors speak of finding eight lesser globules within the larger;
but M&uuml;ller says, that he has counted thirty or forty of different
sizes. This wonderful capsulate situation of its progeny is
well known; indeed it often exhibits itself big with children and
grand-children.</p>

<p>Leeuwenhoeck was the first who noticed this curious animalculum,
and depicted it; a circumstance which has not been mentioned
by Baker and other microscopic writers, who have described
it. It may be found in great plenty in stagnant waters<span class="pagenum" id="Page441">[441]</span>
in spring and summer, and in infusions of hemp-seed and tremella.
Baker describes it as follows: This singular minute water
animal, seen before the microscope, appears to be exactly
globular, without either head, tail, or fins. It moves in all directions,
forwards or backwards, up or down, rolling over and
over like a bowl, spinning horizontally like a top, or gliding
along smoothly without turning itself at all. Sometimes its motions
are very slow, at other times very swift; and when it
pleases, it can turn round as upon an axis very nimbly, without
moving out of its place. The body is transparent, except where
the circular spots are placed, which are probably its young. The
surface of the body in some is as it were dotted all over with
little points, and in others, as if granulated like shagreen. Baker
thought also that in general it appeared as if it was set round
with short moveable hairs. By another writer they are thus
described: These animalcula are at first very small, but grow so
large as to be discerned with the naked eye; they are of a yellowish
green colour, globular figure, and in substance membranaceous
and transparent. In the midst of this substance several
small globes may be perceived; each of these are smaller animalcula,
which have also their diaphanous membrane, and contain
within themselves still smaller generations, which may be distinguished
by the assistance of very powerful glasses. The larger
globules may be seen to escape from the parent, and then increase
in size, as has been already observed.</p>

<p class="hinline">V. membranaceus orbicularis, centro

<p>This animalculum has some resemblance to the volvox uva, but
is sufficiently distinguished by the surrounding bright orbicular
membrane: the middle part is full of clear green globules. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page442">[442]</span>
globules seldom move, though a quivering motion may sometimes
be perceived at the center. It has a slow rotatory motion,
and is found amongst the lemna, in the months of October and
December.</p>

<p class="hinline">V. globosus, moleculis sph&aelig;ricis virescentibus

which are not inclosed in a common membrane.</p>

<p>This animalculum seems to be a kind of medium between the
volvox pilula, <a href="#Infus16">No. 16</a>, and the gonium pectorale, <a href="#Infus114">No. 114</a>, being,
like the one, composed of green spherules, and in form, resembling
the other. It consists of a congeries of equal globules of a greenish
colour, with a bright spot in the middle; the whole mass is sometimes
of a spherical form, sometimes oval, without any common
membrane; a kind of halo may be perceived round it, but whether
this is occasioned by the motion of any invisible hairs has not
been discovered. The mass generally moves from right to left,
and from left to right; scarce any motion can be discovered in
the globules themselves. It was found in the month of August,
in water where the lemna polyrrhiza was growing. Two masses
of these globules have been seen joined together. They contain
from four to fifty of the globules, of which a solitary one may
now and then be found.</p>

<p class="hinline">V. ramulis simplicibus et dichitomis,

<p>It consists of a number of floccose opake branches, which are
invisible to the naked eye; at the apex of these there is a little
congeries of very minute oval pellucid corpuscles. M&uuml;ller at first
thought it to be a species of microscopic and river sertularia; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page443">[443]</span>
afterwards he found the bunches quitting the branches, and
swimming about in the water with a proper spontaneous motion.
Many old branches were found deserted of their globules, while
the younger branches were furnished with them. It was found
in river water in November 1779 and 1780.</p>

<p>The body is shaped like an egg, the fore-part narrow, and
often filled with opake confused intestines; in moving, it elevates
the fore-part of the body. It is found in the same water
as the cyclidium glaucoma, <a href="#Infus86">No. 86</a>, but is three times its size, and
considerably more scarce.</p>

<p>It has a gelatinous transparent body; no visible intestines,
though a pellucid globule is discoverable near the hinder-part;
the body is thickest in the middle, and grows smaller towards
each end. It generally moves side-ways, sometimes in a retrograde

<p>The body is round, of an equal size throughout, and both ends
obtuse; more than half the length is without any visible intestines,
the lower end full of vesicular, pellucid, minute globules;
a large globular vesicle is also to be found in the fore-part; it

<p>This animalculum is perfectly cylindrical, very pellucid, of a
crystalline appearance; it is marked with very fine longitudinal
furrows, and has generally two transparent globules, one placed
below the middle, the other near the extremity of the body; on
the other side are five smaller ones, which are oval. The top is
dilated, with the corners rounded like the spatula, or instrument

<p>This is one of the most minute animalcula, surpassing in slenderness
the monas termo, <a href="#Infus1">No. 1</a>. The greatest magnifier exhibits
little more than a tremulous motion of myriads of little oblong
obscure points. In a few days it almost fills the whole substance

<p>Myriads of this species may be found; it is between the vibrio

as a little line, which is sometimes drawn up in an undulated
shape, and moves backwards and forwards in a straight line, often
without bending the body at all.</p>

<h5 class="inline" id="Infus54">54. <span class="smcap">Vibrio Bacillus.</span></h5>

<p class="hinline">V. linearis, &aelig;qualis utrinque truncata.
Linear vibrio, equally truncated at both ends.</p>

<p>This is an exceeding small creature, but visible with the third
lens; in a certain position of the light, transparent. It is gelatinous,
and not half so large as the monas lens, <a href="#Infus5">No. 5</a>, though six,
and sometimes ten times longer; it is everywhere of an equal
size, and has no visible intestines; its action is languid, the serpentine
flexures of the body are with great difficulty perceived.
M&uuml;ller made two infusions of hay in the same water, and at the
same time, in the one he put the hay whole, in the other it was
cut in small pieces; in the first there were none of the vibrio bacillus,

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page453">[453]</span></p>

<p>A perfect undulating little line, round, gelatinous, without any
visible intestines. It is never straight; when at rest it resembles
the letter V, when in motion the letter M, or a bending line like
that which geese form in their flight through the air; its motions
are so rapid, that the eye can scarce follow them. It generally
rests upon the top of the water, sometimes it fixes itself obliquely
by one extremity, and whirls itself round. This is the little
creature that Leeuwenhoeck says exceeds in slenderness the tail
of the animalculum seminale, which he has described in Fig. 5,
Epis. Phys. 41, being an hundred times less than a mustard-seed,
and on which he makes the following very just observation:
That as these very small animalcula can contract and variously
fold their little tails, we must conclude that tendons and muscles
are as necessary to them as to other animals; if to these we
add the organs of sensation, and those of the intestines, the mind
is lost in the astonishment which arises from the impression of
infinite, in the indefinitely small.</p>

<h5 class="inline" id="Infus56">56. <span class="smcap">Vibrio Serpens.</span></h5>

<p class="hinline">V. filiformis, ambagibus in angulum

obtuse.</p>

<p>A slender gelatinous little animal, in the form of a long serpentine
line, all the bendings being nearly equal in size, and at
equal distances; it generally moves in a straight line; an intestine
may be discovered down the middle. It is to be found in river
water, but is not commonly to be met with.</p>

<h5 class="inline" id="Infus57">57. <span class="smcap">Vibrio Spirillum.</span></h5>

<p class="hinline">V. filiformis, ambagibus in angulum

wire or cork-screw, the bending acute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page454">[454]</span></p>

<p>It is an exceeding minute, singular creature, twisted in a spiral
form; the shape of these bendings remains the same even
when the animal is in motion, not occasioned by any internal
force, but are its natural shape. It moves generally in a straight
line, vibrating the hind and fore-parts. It was found in 1782, in
an infusion of the sonchus arvensis, or corn sow-thistle.</p>

<h5 class="inline" id="Infus58">58. <span class="smcap">Vibrio Vermiculus.</span></h5>

<p class="hinline">V. tortuosus gelatinus. This little
vibrio is twisted and gelatinous.</p>

<p>The body is white, or rather of a milky appearance, cylindric,
long, the apex obtuse, rather growing smaller, and twisted towards
the hind-part. Its motion is languid and undulatory, like
that of the common worm; it sometimes moves quicker, but with
seeming labour. When it bends itself alternately from one side
to the other, a black long line may be discovered, sometimes
whole, sometimes broken: when at rest, it occasionally twists
into various folds. It may be observed easily with the first lens
of the single microscope, and is probably the same animalculum
mentioned by Leeuwenhoeck in all his works, as found in the
dung of frogs, and in the spawn of the male libellula. It is to be
found in marshy water in November, though but seldom.</p>

<h5 class="inline" id="Infus59">59. <span class="smcap">Vibrio Intestinum.</span></h5>

<p class="hinline">V. gelatinosus, teres, antice angustatus.

<p>It is cylindric, milk-coloured, and slender towards the top,
both ends obtuse; no traces of intestines to be discovered, though
four or five spherical eggs are perceived at the extremity of the
hind-part. It can draw the fore-part so much inwards as to
give it a truncated and dilated appearance, something like a spatula.
Its motion is slow and progressive. It is found in marshy
waters.</p>

in the middle of the body.</p>

<p>It is of a small size, and rather less than the following animalculum;
the body is of a pellucid talc-like appearance, the fore and
hind-part truncated; in the middle are two (sometimes there is
only one) pellucid globules, placed lengthwise. It most commonly
moves forward in a straight line; its movements are slow.
It was found in fetid salt water.</p>

smaller than the middle, furnished with three globular points, the
two which are at the extremities being smaller than that at the
middle.</p>

<p>The body is pellucid, talky, each of the ends rather tapering,
furnished with three pellucid globules, the middle one is the
largest; the space between these globules is generally filled with
a green matter; in some there is nothing of the green substance
near the extremities, but only about the middle. It seldom
moves far, and then its motion is rectilinear, backwards and forwards.</p>

<h5 class="inline" id="Infus62">62. <span class="smcap">Vibrio Paxilifer.</span></h5>

<p class="hinline">V. flavescens paleis gregariis multifariam
ordinatis. <a href="#Plate25">Plate XXV.</a> Fig. 13, 14, 15. Yellow, gregarious,
straw-like vibrio.</p>

<p>This is a wonderful animalculum, or rather a congeries of animalcula.
It is invisible to the naked eye, and consists of a
transparent membrane, with yellow intestines, and two or three<span class="pagenum" id="Page456">[456]</span>
visible points; they are generally found collected together in
different parcels, from seven to forty in number, and ranged in a
variety of forms, sometimes in a straight line, as in Fig. 14, then
forming the concave Figure 13, at others, moving in a zig-zag
direction, as in Fig. 15; when at rest they are generally in a quadrangular
form, and found in great plenty with the ulva latissima,
or brown laver.</p>

<p>As this animalculum seems to have some affinity with the hair-like
animal of Baker, I think the reader will be better pleased to
see his description of it introduced in this place, than to have it
raised into a new and distinct species.</p>

<p>This little animal is extremely slender, and not uncommonly
one-hundred and fifty times longer than broad. Its resemblance
to an hair induced Baker to call it the hair-like insect. The body
or middle part, which is nearly straight, appears in some composed
of such parallel rings as the windpipe of land animals consists
of, but seems in others scaled, or rather made up of rings
that obliquely cross each other. Its two ends are bent or hooked,
pretty nearly in the same degree, but in a direction contrary
each to the other; and as no eyes can be discerned, it is difficult
to judge which is the head or tail. Its progressive motion differs
from that of all animals hitherto described; for, notwithstanding
the body is composed of many rings and joints, it seems
unable to bend them, or move directly forwards; but when it is
inclinable to change its quarters, it can move from right to left,
or left to right, and proceed at the same time backwards or forwards
obliquely; and this it performs by turning upon one end
as a center, and describing with the other the quarter of a circle;
then it does the same with the other end, and so alternately;
whereby its progression is in a diagonal line, or from corner to
corner. Of this any one may immediately be satisfied, who will<span class="pagenum" id="Page457">[457]</span>
take the trouble of shifting the points of a pair of compasses in
that manner. All its motions are extremely slow, and require
much patience and attention in the observer. It has neither feet,
fins, nor hairs, but appears perfectly smooth and transparent,
with the head bending one way, and the tail another, so as to be
like a long Italic S; nor is any internal motion, or particularly
opake part, to be perceived, which may determine one to suppose
it either the stomach, or the intestines.</p>

<p>These creatures are so small, that millions of millions might be
contained in an inch square. When viewed singly, or separated
from one another, they are exceedingly transparent, and of a
lovely green; but, like all other transparent bodies, when numbers
of them are brought together they become opake, and lose
their green colour in proportion as the quantity increases, till at
last they appear entirely black.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the extreme minuteness of these animalcula,
they seem to be fond of society; for, on viewing for some time a
parcel of them taken up at random, they will be seen to disperse
themselves in a kind of regular order. If a multitude of them be
put into a jar of water, they will form themselves into a regular
body, and ascend slowly to the top, where, after they have remained
some time exposed to the air, their green colour changes
to a beautiful sky-blue. When they are weary of this situation,
they form themselves into a kind of rope, which slowly descends
as low as they intend.</p>

<p>A small quantity of the substance containing these creatures
having been put into a jar of water, it so happened, that one part
descended immediately to the bottom, the other continuing to
float on the surface. After some time, each of these swarms of
animalcula exhibited a disposition to change its quarters. Both<span class="pagenum" id="Page458">[458]</span>
armies, therefore, set out at the same time, the one proceeding
upwards, and the other downwards; so that after some hours
journey they met in the middle. A desire of knowing how they
would conduct themselves on this occasion, engaged the observer
to watch them carefully; and to his surprize, he saw the army
that was marching upwards open to the right and left, to make
room for those that were descending. Thus without confusion
or intermixture each held on its way, the ascending army marching
in two columns to the top, and the other proceeding in one
column to the bottom, as if each had been under the direction of
wise leaders.</p>

<p>This eel is both oviparous and viviparous; it is filiform, but in
other respects differs considerably from the paste eel. It is longer,
not near so large, the tail is smaller and more tapering; it
moves with much greater ease, and is more lively. In the tail of
this eel we may observe in miniature, what may be seen on a
much larger scale in that of the viper, viz. a small projection
somewhat resembling a tongue, which occasionally appears as
delineated in the figure at <i>a b</i>, and at other times adheres close to<span class="pagenum" id="Page462">[462]</span>
the body. An alimentary duct may be easily discovered, but no
other intestines can be discerned, without deranging altogether
the organization of the animalculum. The pungent taste of vinegar
was formerly attributed to these animalcula, an opinion
which was soon exploded.</p>

<p>The eels in paste have been more distinguished than most other
animalcula, as well on account of their many curious properties,
as the various speculations and theories to which they have given
rise. Four different species of eels may be found in paste; of the
first, I shall now give a particular description. The body is filiform
or like a thread, round, pellucid, replete with little grains in
the middle, both extremities very pellucid and empty, the fore-part
a little truncated, the hind-part terminating in a very short
bristly point. It is the same of every age and size. To be certain
of procuring this species of eels, boil some flower in water, to
which you have added a few drops of vinegar; provide an earthen
pot which has an hole at the bottom, and fill it with earth; then
put the paste in a piece of coarse cloth, and bury it in this earth; the
pot is to be exposed to the sun in the summer, or kept in a warm
place in the winter; by these means in ten or twelve days you will
very seldom fail of finding a large quantity of eels in the paste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page463">[463]</span></p>

<p>This eel, when at its full growth, is about one-tenth of an inch
long, and rather less than one-hundredth of an inch in diameter.
Fig. 6 represents one of these eels magnified about one-hundred
and twenty times, only compressed so much between two plates,
by means of an adjusting screw, as not only to prevent it from
moving, but to lengthen and flatten it in a small degree. At the
upper part there are two little moveable pieces or nipples, <i>a a</i>,
between which an empty space <i>b</i> is formed, that terminates in
the mouth; the hinder-part is round, but there projects from it a
short setaceous tail <i>w</i>; in the young eels the termination of the
tail is not so abrupt as in the present specimen, but it finishes by
a gradual diminution. There is probably a vent near <i>z</i>, for the
passage of the excrements; because when that part has been
gently pressed, two or three jets of a very subtile substance have
been observed to issue from it. If the pressure be increased, a
small bladder will be forced out, a further compression bursts the
bladder, and the intestines are forced through the opening.</p>

<p>A greater degree of magnifying power is necessary to obtain
an exact idea of the viscera of these eels. Fig. 10 represents the
alimentary duct further magnified, from its origin to the belly.
It is shewn here as separated from the animal, which is easily
effected; for nature, assisted by very little art, performs the operation.
The oesophagus, <i>b c</i>; Fig. 6 and 10, at its origin <i>a a</i>, is
very small, but soon grows larger, as at <i>c</i>, and forms a kind of
oblong bag, <i>c d</i>; the diameter of this increases till it comes to <i>d</i>,
where it swells out as at <i>d e f</i>; it then grows smaller till it comes
to <i>g</i>, when it again swells out at <i>g k l</i>. The part <i>k l</i> is the stomach.
M. Becli has shewn, that the alimentary duct of many
species of worms is formed of two bags, one of which is inclosed
within the other. It is the same with this animalculum; the
little vessel <i>b c</i>, that we have called the oesophagus, which is the
origin of the bag <i>c d</i>, enters into the same bag, and preserves its<span class="pagenum" id="Page464">[464]</span>
form within it till it comes to <i>m</i>, from whence it is prolonged in
the form of a black line <i>m n</i>, which passes by the axis of the
duct <i>e</i>, and apparently terminates itself at the beginning of the
abdomen <i>l</i>. To this tube, near the center of the swelling <i>g k l</i>,
are fixed two small transparent bodies; that end of these which
is connected with the tube is round, the other end is pointed;
these small pieces cannot be discerned in every position of the
eel.</p>

<p>I shall now shew how this duct is to be forced out of the
eel. The body, when compressed, generally bursts either at the
head or tail, and always at that part which is least pressed;
hence when the mass of fluids contained in the body is forced
towards the anterior part, they meet with a resistance in passing
from the abdomen to the duct already described; the abdomen,
being forced by the fluids which are made to act against it,
bursts at the upper end, and the fluids, striking against the
neck, force it, with all its contents, out of the body, through an
opening at the anterior part; on lessening the pressure, the intestine
thus discharged will float in the water between the two
plates of glass.</p>

<p>Not to enter into a detail of those parts which have been supposed
by some writers to constitute the heart, &amp;c. of these minute
animalcula, it will be sufficient here to describe those in which
motion may be discovered, and to leave the rest to future observations
on the subject. The parts which may be seen in motion
within these minute creatures are, 1. the small tube or duct,
from its origin at <i>m</i>, to the two appendages; 2. these appendages
themselves, <i>h</i>; 3. the remainder of the tube, from the appendages
to the insertion at the ventricle <i>k</i>; 4. in the swelling <i>g k l</i>. The
rest of this duct, from the beginning by the oesophagus <i>b c</i>, to
the second swelling, has no motion. There is a variety in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page465">[465]</span>
motions of the first part of this duct, sometimes it dilates and
contracts, at other times it has an oscillatory motion. It is difficult
to gain a good view of the appendages; but when the position
of the little creature is favourable, they seem to have a two-fold
motion, by which the pointed ends approach to, and then
separate from, each other, and another by which they move up
and down. The part <i>g k l</i> moves backwards and forwards alternately;
the motion of each of these parts is independent of the
rest. These are the principal parts, whose motion is connected
with the life of the animal.</p>

<p>The other viscera that are contained in the body of the eel, and
which may be observed by the aid of the microscope, are, the
vessels which contain the food, those which are filled with a
transparent substance, and the womb or ovary. The first form
the abdomen and intestines; these are filled with a black substance,
which prevents their being properly and clearly distinguished;
these vessels, in their passage through the posterior part
of the body, form an empty space, in which we may perceive
that one side of the animalculum is occupied by the ovary <i>q q q</i>,
which runs from <i>j</i> to <i>u x</i>; it is at these two extremities of the
ovaries that the eggs begin to be formed, for the largest eggs are
always to be found in the middle, and the smallest at the ends,
as may be seen at <i>j f</i> and <i>u x</i>.</p>

<p>All the eels which bear eggs have two protuberances, <i>y y</i>,
formed on the exterior part near the center of the ovary; it appears
like a transparent semicircular membrane, but is really a
kind of hernia or bag, in which one or two eggs may be sometimes
seen; all the larger eels have this appendage, which also
bears the marks of having been burst. Now, as the younger eels
have not this appendage, nor any marks of a rupture, we may<span class="pagenum" id="Page466">[466]</span>
reasonably conclude that it is from hence that the little eels issue
from the parent.</p>

<p>In the latter part of the year, and during the winter, these eels
are oviparous, and the young eels may be seen to proceed from
the egg; at other times they are viviparous; six live eels have
been seen at one time in the belly of the parent, twenty-two
eggs have been counted in the ovary. M&uuml;ller suspected that
there was a difference of sex in some of these animalcula, but it
was left to M. Roffredi to afford the proof, and it was only from
a variety of repeated observations that he could allow himself to
be convinced of this truth. He continued his researches upon
the same subject on other microscopic eels, and has since been
able to distinguish the sexual parts of the vinegar eels.</p>

<p>The second species of paste eel is oviparous. It is easily distinguished
from the first kind by being much smaller; in Fig. 8,
is exhibited a magnified view of this eel. The conformation of
the alimentary duct and the intestines are in general nearly the
same, though an intelligent observer will find out some specific
differences. By the flexion of the intestines <i>c c c</i>, a void space is
left a little beyond the middle of the body, where the ovary, <i>d d</i>,
is situated. There is no exterior protuberance near this ovary, as
in the preceding one.</p>

<p>We meet with another eel in paste, which may with propriety
be called the common eel. It is often to be found in grains placed
in the earth, in which the germ is destroyed, in the roots and
stems of farinaceous plants, in the tremella of Adanson, and in
several species of conferva, as well as in several infusions. This
eel, when at its full growth is rather longer than the common
eel of blighted wheat; one of them is represented at Fig. 11.<span class="pagenum" id="Page467">[467]</span>
They are easily distinguished from the eels of blighted wheat,
because they have no ranges of globules like it, by the two little
protuberances which are near the middle of the body, and by the
regular diminution of the tail. It is oviparous.</p>

<p>A very small species, represented at Fig. 9, may also be found
in paste; they may be distinguished from the young eels of the
larger sort by their vivacity and slenderness.</p>

<p>As the eels in paste are objects which are so often exhibited in
the microscope, it will be proper, before we leave this subject, to
inform the reader how he may procure the young eels from the
parent animalcula; a discovery which was originally made by
Mr. Sherwood, but more particularly pursued and described by
Baker. Take up a very small quantity of paste where these eels
abound on the point of a pin, or with a sharpened quill; lay it on
a slip of glass, and dilute it well with water; by these means, many
of them will become visible to the naked eye; then with the nib of
a pen cut to a very fine point, and shaved so thin as to be extremely
pliable, single out one of the largest eels, and insinuate the point
of the pen underneath it; remove it into a very small drop of
water, which you must have ready prepared on another slip of
glass. When thus confined, it may easily be cut asunder transversely,
by the help of a good eye and steady hand, with a lancet
or sharp penknife; or if the eye be deficient, a hand-magnifier
will enable almost any person to perform the operation. As soon
as the parts are separated, apply your object to the microscope,
and if the division has been made about the middle of the animal,
several oval bodies of different sizes will be seen to issue
forth. These are young anguillul&aelig; of different degrees of maturity,
each of which is coiled up, and included in its proper membrane,
of so exquisite a fineness, as to be scarce discernible by<span class="pagenum" id="Page468">[468]</span>
the greatest magnifier while it incloses the embryo animal.
The largest and most forward break immediately through this
delicate integument, unfold themselves, and wriggle about nimbly
in the water; others get out, uncoil, and move about more
slowly; and the least mature continue entirely without motion.
The uterus or vessel that contains all these oval bodies is composed
of many annula or ringlets, not unlike the aspera arteria of
land animals, and it seems to be considerably elastic; for as soon
as the operation is performed, the oval bodies are thrust out
with some degree of violence by the spring or action of this
bowel. An hundred or upwards of young ones have been seen
to issue from one single eel, whereby the prodigious increase of
them may be accounted for, as probably several such numerous
generations are produced in a short time. Hereby we also learn
that these creatures are not only like eels in shape, but are likewise
viviparous, as eels are generally supposed to be.</p>

<p>Few experiments are to be found more entertaining, or in
which there is so little risk of being disappointed; for they seem,
like earth-worms, to be all prolific, and you may be sure of success,
unless by accident you cut one that has already brought
forth all its young, or make your trials when the paste has been
kept a very long time, in which cases they have been found
unfruitful.</p>

<p>The body of this is exceedingly transparent, with no visible
entrails, though a few transverse lines may be discovered on the
body. It is sometimes, though rarely, furnished with a long row
of little globules, and often with two small oval ones; the tail
terminates in a point. M&uuml;ller says he found these eels in the sediment
which is formed by vegetables on the sides of vessels in
which water had been kept for some time.</p>

<p>This, when pressed between two plates of glass, appears to be
little more than a crystalline skin, with a kind of clay-coloured
intestines. The fore-part of the body is truncated, the lower
part drawn out to a fine point, the rest of the body is of an equal
size throughout. The younger ones are filled with pellucid molecular
intestines.</p>

<h6>OF THE EELS IN BLIGHTED WHEAT.</h6>

<p class="plateref"><a href="#Plate11">Plate XI.</a> Fig. 4 and 5.</p>

<p>These animalcula were discovered by Needham, and described
by him in a work entitled, New Microscopical Discoveries, and
afterwards more fully treated upon by Baker. They are not
lodged in those blighted, grains which are covered externally
with a soot-like dust, whose inside is often also little more
than a black powder; but abundance of ears may be observed in
some fields of corn, which have grains that appear blackish, as if
scorched: these, when opened, are found to contain a soft white
substance, that when attentively examined looks like a congeries<span class="pagenum" id="Page470">[470]</span>
of threads or fibres lying as close as possible to each other in a
parallel direction, and much resembling the unripe down of some
thistles. This fibrous matter does not discover any signs of life
or motion, unless water be applied to it; the fibres then separate,
and prove themselves to be living creatures.</p>

<p>These eels are in general of a large size, and may be seen with
a common magnifying glass, being about one-thirtieth of an inch
in length, and one-hundred and fortieth broad. Fig. 5 represents
one of them magnified about one-hundred and twenty times;
they are in general of a bright chesnut colour, the extremity <i>a b</i>
is whiter and more transparent than the rest of the body. The
end <i>a</i> is rather round, the end <i>c</i> is pointed. A distinguishing
mark of these little creatures is a row of transparent globules,
which are placed at intervals through the whole length of the
body, beginning at <i>b</i>, where the transparency of the fore-part
ceases, and going on towards the extremity <i>c</i>. They are in diameter
rather less than one-third of the body. Another peculiar
mark is a small lunular space <i>d</i>, near the middle of the body.
This part is transparent, and is free from the coloured matter of
the intestines; there is a neck in the intestines near this space,
which confines them to one part of the body.</p>

<p>Great care should be taken by the observer, not to burst the
skin of the eels in disengaging them from the grain, for they
never break or burst of themselves; but if broke, visible intestines,
filled with a black matter, rush out of the body, from
which little black globules are disengaged; if the observation be
made immediately after these globules proceed from the eel, they
swim slowly about the water, though divested of any principle
of internal motion; but if the eels that are broke be left long in
the water, the same ph&aelig;nomena will take place, as in other<span class="pagenum" id="Page471">[471]</span>
animal and vegetable infusions. The want of due attention to
these circumstances has been productive of many of the fanciful
positions of Needham, which were deduced from ill-conducted
experiments; and, consequently, when properly examined, are
found to be in a great measure false.</p>

<p>M. Roffredi sowed some of the grains of this wheat, which
sprang up; but the ear was either wholly or in a great measure
spoiled, being filled with these eels. He also found them in other
parts of the plant; in order to disengage them, the plant must be
soaked in water, and then compressed a little. At first sight
these eels seem to resemble the foregoing, but a more accurate
inspection shews that they have neither the same curious disposition
of the internal globules, nor the transparent place in the
middle of the body. The intestinal bag leaves indeed in these an
empty space, but it is of an undetermined form. The animalcula
from the plant are much more lively than those which are procured
from the dried grains.</p>

<p>The principal ph&aelig;nomena in this kind of blighted wheat is
probably owing to these animalcula, who prevent the regular
circulation of the sap. They increase in size in a certain proportion
to the plant, so that at last they may be observed with
great ease by the naked eye, being two-tenths of an inch long,
and nearly one-tenth in diameter. Fig. 4 represents one of these
magnified nearly in the same proportion as Fig. 5; <i>a a a a</i>, the
ovary, which may be traced almost from the lower extremity to
the middle of the body, where the body becomes so opake as to
prevent its being seen any further. The eggs, when arrived at
their full growth, are nearly of a cylindric shape, both ends
rounded; towards the extremity <i>b</i> there are two little protuberances
<i>d d</i>, through which the eggs are most probably extruded;
these protuberances are not always visible. The eggs are formed<span class="pagenum" id="Page472">[472]</span>
of a fine transparent membrane; it covers the young eel, which is
folded curiously therein; these eggs may be frequently found in
the plant.</p>

<p>A most satisfactory view of these eels is obtained by examining
them with the solar microscope; it affords one of the most
surprizing and magnificent spectacles; two generations may be
often seen, one, which draws near the allotted period of its existence,
and another which only begins to enjoy the blessings of
life: some arrived at their full growth, and others quite small.
In some we may perceive the young animalcula in motion in the
eggs, in others, no such motion can be observed; with a variety
of other circumstances too tedious to enumerate, though they
afford great pleasure to the spectator.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable circumstances in these animalcula
is the faculty they have of receiving again the powers of life,
after having lost them for a considerable time; for instance, when
some of these blighted grains, that have been preserved for many
years, have been soaked in water for ten or twelve hours, living
eels of this species have been found in it; if the water evaporate,
or begin to fail, they cease to move, but, on a fresh application,
will be again revived.<a href="#Footnote125" id="FNanchor125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote125"><a href="#FNanchor125" class="label">[125]</a> The property
of revivification is not confined to this species, being common to other
kinds of worms, and it is not improbable that the hydr&aelig; may possess the same faculty. <span class="smcap">Edit.</span></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>It may be proper to notice here, that according to the observations
of Roffredi, those eels which have done laying of eggs
are incapable of being resuscitated upon being moistened; the
same seems to be also the case with those that are very young; it
is probable they must attain a certain age and degree of strength
before they are endowed with this wonderful faculty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page473">[473]</span></p>

<p>In the month of August, 1743, a small parcel of blighted wheat
was sent by Mr. Needham to Martin Folkes, Esq. President of
the Royal Society, with an account of his then new discovery;
which parcel the president was pleased to give to Mr. Baker, desiring
him to examine it carefully. In order so to do, he cut
open some of the grains that were become dry, took out the
fibrous matter, and applied water to it on a slip of glass, but
could discern no other motion than a separation of the fibres or
threads, which separation he imputed wholly to an elasticity in
the fibres; and perceiving no token of life, after watching them
with due care, and repeating the experiment till he was weary,
an account thereof was written to Needham, who, having by
trials of his own, found out the cause of this bad success, advised
him to steep the grains before he attempted to open them; on
doing which he was very soon convinced of his veracity, and entertained
with the pleasing sight of this wonderful ph&aelig;nomenon.
At different times after this, Baker made experiments with grains
of the same parcel, without being once disappointed. He soaked
a couple of grains in water for the space of thirty-six hours,
when, believing them sufficiently moistened, he cut one open,
and applying some of the fibrous substance to the microscope in
a drop of water, it separated immediately, and presented multitudes
of the anguillul&aelig; without the least motion or sign of life;
but being taught by experience that they might notwithstanding
possibly revive, he left them for about four hours, and then examining
them again, found much the greatest number moving
their extremities pretty briskly, and in an hour or two after they
appeared as lively as these creatures usually are. Mr. Folkes
and some other friends were witnesses of this experiment. We
find an instance here that life may be suspended and seemingly
destroyed; that by an exhalation of the fluids necessary to a
living animal, the circulations may cease, all the organs and vessels
of the body may be shrunk up, dried, and hardened; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page474">[474]</span>
yet, after a long while, life may begin anew to actuate the same
body, and all the animal motions and faculties may be restored,
merely by replenishing the organs and vessels with a fresh supply
of fluid. Here is a proof that the animalcula in the grains
of blighted wheat can endure having their bodies quite dried up
for the space of four years together, without being thereby deprived
of the property of resuscitation.</p>

<p>It appears plainly from the foregoing experiments, that when
the blighted grains of wheat have been kept a long time, and the
bodies of these animalcula are consequently become extremely
dry, the rigidity of their minute vessels requires to be relaxed
very gently, and by exceeding slow degrees; for we find that,
on the application of water immediately to the bodies of these
animalcula, when taken from the dry grains, they do not so certainly
revive, as they do if the grains themselves be either buried
in earth, or steeped in water for some time before they are
taken out: the reason of which most probably is, that too sudden
a relaxation bursts their delicate and tender organs, and thereby
renders them incapable of being any more employed to perform
the actions of life; and, indeed, there are always some dead ones
amongst the living, whose bodies appear bursten, or lacerated, as
well as others that lie extended and never come to life.</p>

<p>Some discretion is needful to adapt the time of continuing the
grains in water or earth to the age and dryness of them; for if
they be not opened before they have been too much or too long
softened, the animalculum will not only seem dead, but will really
be so. Of the two grains mentioned to have been four years old
when put to soak, one was opened after it had lain thirty-six
hours, and the event proved as already related; the other was suffered
to lie for above a week, on opening which, all the anguillul&aelig;
near the husk were found dead, and seemingly in a decayed condition;<span class="pagenum" id="Page475">[475]</span>
but great numbers issued alive from the middle, and moved
themselves briskly. Unless the husks be opened to let these creatures
out after being steeped, they all inevitably perish; and when
taken out and preserved in water, if the husks be left with them,
they will die in a few days; but otherwise, continue alive in water
for several months together; and, should the water evaporate, may
be revived again by giving them a fresh supply.</p>

the hind-part obtuse. The trunk itself is rather rounding or
tending to the gibbous, and filled with very small molecules;
there are also two bright globules, one within the hind extremity,

transparent that they can scarce be discerned, when it is empty;
when full, they are of a green colour, and there are dark globules
discoverable in the middle.</p>

<p>In plenty of water it moves swiftly in a circular and diagonal
direction; whenever it moves slowly it seems to be taking in
water, the intestines are then also in a violent commotion. Two
of the smaller ones may often be perceived cohering to each
other, and drawing one another by turns; nor are they separated
by death, for they remain united even when the water is evaporated.
Those who are not familiar with these kinds of observations,
may easily mistake the shade in a single one for a junction

ciliated, though the hairs have not been discovered.</p>

<p>The intestines are filled with a blue liquor, forming in a tube,
which, from the aperture to the middle of the body, is divided
into two legs or branches; beyond the middle there are two little

it is not easy to describe it; it is sometimes spherical, sometimes
like a long cylinder, at other times of an oval figure, white and
gelatinous; the tail is filiform and flexible, the upper part vibrating
vehemently; no visible viscera; a pellucid globule may be

<p>This animalculum varies its form so much, that it might be
mistaken for the proteus of Baker, though, in fact, it is totally
different. The body sometimes appears of an oblong, sometimes
of a triangular, and sometimes of a kidney shape. The tail is
generally short, thick, and annulated, but sometimes long, flexible,
cylindric, and without rings; vibrating, when stretched out, with
so much velocity, that it appears as it were double. The intestines
are not very distinct; a small pellucid globule, which M&uuml;ller
supposes to be its mouth, is observable at the apex; and two
black points not easily discovered, he thinks are its eyes; sometimes
it draws the tail entirely into the body. It walks slowly
after taking three or four steps, and extends the tail, erecting it
perpendicularly, shaking and bending it; in which state it very
much resembles a leaf of the lemna. Fig. 33, <i>a</i>, the body rather

tail; the head resembles that of a herring; the trunk is cylindric,
replete with black spiral intestines, and appears more or less extended,
at the will of the animal; nothing is to be discovered in
the hinder-part. The tail most commonly appears to be divided
into two bristles. The intestines are in a continual motion when
the body moves, and by reason of their various shades give it a
very rough appearance; some lateral hairs or cilia are likewise
to be perceived. When it moves, it revolves at the same time as
upon an axis. It is to be found in November and December, in
marshy places that are covered with the lemna. Fig. 36, <i>a</i>, the

way in a spiral line. When the water begins to fail, they
assume an oblong, oval, or cylindric figure; the hind-part of some

<p>Baker in his Employment for the Microscope, p. 260-266,
dignifies this animalculum with the name of proteus, on account
of its assuming a great number of different shapes, so as scarce to
be known for the same animal in its various transformations;
and, indeed, unless it be carefully watched while passing from
one shape to another, it will often become suddenly invisible.</p>

about the sides, some of which being taken up with the
point of a penknife, placed on a slip of glass in a drop of water,

several kinds of little animals that are seldom seen swimming
about at large. The insect we are treating of is one of these,
and was discovered in such slime-like matter taken from the side
of a glass jar, in which small fishes, water-snails, and other creatures
had been kept. Its body in substance and colour resembled
that of a snail; the shape thereof was somewhat elliptical,
but pointed at one end, whilst from the other proceeded a long,
slender, and finely proportioned neck, terminated with a head, of

of the latter are in vehement motion. Other fascicles of moving
hair may likewise be observed, and the variegated and quick

<p>This animalculum has long been known by the name of the
wheel animal; in the description of which no person appears to
have succeeded so well as Baker; and to him every writer has
since referred for an ample account of this curious little being.
What I shall now say on the subject will be chiefly extracted
from the same source of information, with such alterations and
additions as appear to be necessary to render his account more
complete.</p>

<p>I shall begin with observing, that M&uuml;ller&#8217;s wheel animal differs
in some respects from that of Baker&#8217;s; first, with regard to the
rotatory organs which are extended on the back like ears; secondly,
the two little splendid substances within the body; and
thirdly, the two black points near the top of the head, which are
probably the creature&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>This little animal is found in rain water that has stood for some
days in leaden gutters; in the hollows of lead on the tops of
houses; or in the slime and sediment left in rain water; they are
also sometimes to be met with in ditches and amongst duck-weed.</p>

<p>It has been called the wheel animal, because it is furnished
with a pair of instruments, which in figure and motion resemble
wheels. It appears only as a living creature when immersed in
water; notwithstanding which, it may be kept for many months
out of water, and in a state of perfect dryness, without losing the
principle of life. When dry, it is of a globular form, about the
size of a grain of sand, and without any apparent signs of life.<span class="pagenum" id="Page550">[550]</span>
If it be put into water, in the space of half an hour a languid
motion begins, the globule turns itself about, lengthens itself by
slow degrees, and becomes very lively; in a short time it protrudes
its wheels, and swims about in search of food; or else,
fixing itself by its tail, brings the food to it by its rotatory organs,
which throw the whole circumjacent fluid into a violent commotion;
when its hunger is satisfied, it generally becomes quiescent,
and sometimes resumes its globular form.</p>

<p>If the water that is found standing in gutters of lead, or the
sediment it has left behind, has any appearance of a red or a dark
brown colour, little doubt need be entertained of its containing
these animalcula. In the summer season, if a small quantity of
this dust be put into water, and placed under a microscope, it
seldom fails of discovering a great number of minute reddish globules,
which are, in fact, the animals themselves. It will be best
to view them first with the third or fourth magnifiers, and afterward
apply those possessing greater powers.</p>

<p>The motions of this little creature somewhat resemble those of
a caterpillar; like many of those insects, removing itself from
place to place by first fixing the tail to some substance, then extending
the whole body, fixing the head, and afterward drawing
the tail to it; by these alternate actions it moves with some degree
of swiftness.</p>

<p>This animal frequently changes its appearance, and assumes a
very different form; for, the snout being drawn inwards, the
fore-part becomes clubbed, and immediately dividing, exhibits to
our view two circular instruments set with minute hairs, that
move very briskly, sometimes in a rotatory, at other times in a
kind of trembling or vibratory manner. An aperture or mouth is<span class="pagenum" id="Page551">[551]</span>
also perceived between the two semicircles; whilst in this state,
the animal may often be perceived swimming about in pursuit of
food.</p>

<p>The most distinguishing parts of this animalculum are, the
head, the thorax, and the abdomen. It differs from any other
creature hitherto described in the wonderful form and structure
of its head; the sudden changes of which from one form to another
are equally surprizing and singular; from being of a very
taper form, it becomes almost instantaneously as broad as any
part of its body, and protrudes an amazingly curious machinery
formed to procure its food.</p>

<p>The circular bodies which project from the animal have much
the resemblance of wheels, appearing to turn round with considerable
velocity, by which means a very rapid current of water is
brought from a great distance to its mouth. As these wheels are
very transparent, the edges excepted, which are set with fibrill&aelig;,
as cogs to a wheel, it is difficult to determine how the rotatory
motions are performed, or whether their figure be flat, concave,
or conical; be this as it may, they are protruded from a couple of
tubular cases, into which they can be again withdrawn, at the
will and pleasure of the animal. They do not always turn the
same way, nor with the same degree of velocity, sometimes moving
in opposite directions, at other times both one way. The
figure varies according to the degree of their protrusion, as well
as from other circumstances. They appear occasionally like minute
oblong squares, rising from the periphery of a circle; at
other times they terminate in sharp points, and sometimes they
are curved, bending the same way like so many hooks; now and
then the ends appear clubbed, or in resemblance like a number of
small mallets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page552">[552]</span></p>

<p>When the fore-part of this creature is first seen to open or divide,
the parts, which when fully protruded resemble wheels,
seem only like a couple of semicircles, the edges of which are set
with little spicul&aelig;, having a nimble, and continually vibrating
motion upwards and downwards, for the purpose of agitating the
water, each wheel being in this case doubled, or like a round
piece of paper folded in the middle.</p>

<p>When the wheels are in motion, the head appears very large in
proportion to the size of the animal; and though it is then everywhere
transparent, yet a ring or circle, more particularly distinguished
by its brightness, may be perceived about the middle of
the forehead, from whence many vessels are seen to originate.</p>

<p>The thorax or breast is united to the head by a short annular
circle or neck; the size of the thorax is nearly one-sixth part of
the whole animalculum. In it the heart is distinctly seen; being
placed nearly in the center, the diastole and systole cannot fail to
attract the eye of every attentive observer; the alternate dilatation
and contraction is very perceptible through the back of the
animal, being performed with great strength and vigour. It
appears to be composed of two semilunar parts, which in the
time of contraction approach each other laterally, and form between
them a figure somewhat like a horse-shoe, whose upper
side is flat, the under one convex. In the diastole, these two
parts separate; the separation begins exactly in the middle of the
lower part next the tail. In each of the semilunar parts there is
a cavity, which closes when they come together; and opens when
they separate.</p>

<p>The motion of the heart is communicated to all the other parts
of the thorax, and indeed through the whole animal. It is necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page553">[553]</span>
however to remark, that this motion is sometimes suspended,
or at least quite imperceptible, for two or three minutes,
after which it re-commences, and goes on with the same vigour
and regularity as before. From the under part of the thorax a
small transparent horn proceeds, which cannot be seen unless the
insect turns on its back or side.</p>

<p>Below the thorax there is an annular circle that joins the thorax
to the abdomen; this is considerably the largest part of the
animal, and contains the stomach and viscera. When full of
food, the intestines are opake, and of a crimson colour, extending
from the thorax quite through the abdomen and a great part of
the tail, exhibiting a fine view of the peristaltic motion, or those
gradual contractions and dilatations of the intestines, which propel
their contents downwards. Numerous ramifications of vessels,
both longitudinal and transverse, surround the intestines.
The abdomen is not only capable of contraction, but also admits
of such a degree of extension, as to form a case for all the other
parts of the body. The tail extends from a joint at the lower
part of the belly to the posterior extremity; it is of a tapering
form, and consists generally of three joints; when the animal is
inclined to fix itself to any thing by the tail, it thrusts out four,
sometimes six, little hooks from the extreme part; these are
placed in pairs, one at the very extremity itself, the other two a
little way up the sides; the three pair are seldom seen at the
same time. The wheels appear to be the organs used by the
animal to assist it in swimming.</p>

<p>All the actions of this creature seem to imply sagacity and
quickness of sensation; at the least touch or motion in the water,
they instantly draw in their wheels. Baker conjectures that they
have eyes lodged near the wheels, because while they are in the
globular or maggot state, their motions are slow and stumbling;<span class="pagenum" id="Page554">[554]</span>
but after the wheels are protruded, they are performed with great
regularity, swiftness, and steadiness. Can we sufficiently admire
the wonderful contrivance in the apparatus of this animal? a
being so diminutive, as not to exceed in size a grain of sand!</p>

<p><a href="#Plate26">Plate XXVI.</a> Fig. 17, represents the wheel animal in what Baker
calls the maggot state; while in this form small spicul&aelig; are
seen to dart out near the anterior part; the snout is sometimes
more, at other times less acute than in this delineation. <i>a</i>, a
small horn near the thorax.</p>

<p>Fig. 15 represents its manner of moving from place to place,
while in the maggot state. <i>a</i>, the projecting horn.</p>

<p>Fig. 12 exhibits it with the two semicircular parts, <i>a a</i>, protruded,
and in the posture in which it places itself, when preparing
to swim about, or going to set its wheels in motion.</p>

<p>Fig. 1 shews the head at its full extent, and a couple of small
bodies, <i>a a</i>, on the top of it, armed with small teeth, <i>b</i>, like those
of the balance-wheel of a watch.</p>

<p>At Fig. 18 the interior parts are more particularly exhibited.
<i>a</i>, the circle from which many vessels originate; <i>b</i>, the thorax or
breast, joined to the head by the neck, <i>c</i>; the part which is supposed
to be the heart is plainly seen at <i>d</i>; the abdomen, <i>f</i>, is separated
from the breast by a ring, <i>e</i>; <i>g</i>, the tail.</p>

<p>Fig. 19 exhibits the animal not fully extended, though with its
wheels in motion.</p>

<p>Fig. 20 shews it with its side towards the eye; in this position
one of the wheels, <i>a</i>, appears to lie considerably below the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page555">[555]</span></p>

<p>Fig. 6 and 16 represent two of these creatures in the postures
in which they are frequently seen when the wheels are not protruded,
but with the fibrill&aelig;, <i>a b</i>, vibrating quickly.</p>

<p>Fig. 2 exhibits the animal with the body nearly drawn into the
abdomen; at Fig. 21, the body still further drawn in; at Fig. 22,
as it appears with the tail partly drawn in; at Fig. 23, in a globular
form, but still adhering by the tail.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when in the maggot form, it rolls its head and tail
together, without drawing them into the body; as represented at
Fig. 14.</p>

<p>Baker has also described three other species, one of which, differing
only from the preceding in having a very long tail, is represented
at Fig. 7.</p>

<p>Fig. 11 is another kind, with crustaceous spicul&aelig;, <i>b</i>, at the fore-part;
within this, at <i>c</i>, an opake oval body may be seen, which

a sphere from a mouldy center. They contract or extend
their bodies either when alone or associated, and excite a vortex in
the water by means of the disc. When they quit the society, and
act singly, their parts may be more readily distinguished, and will
be found to consist of a head, abdomen, and tail. The head is
often drawn back so far into the abdomen, that it cannot be seen,
exhibiting only a projecting, broad kidney-shaped disc. The abdomen,

they were found adhering to a vegetable substance.</p>

<p id="Infus382">382. Fig. <i>E E E</i>. Several appearances of an animalculum found
in stagnant water in September, about the one-hundredth part of
an inch in length; it moved slowly, and there appeared a wheel-like
motion in certain fibrill&aelig; in the head. The double-forked
part of the tail had a similar motion to the tail of the pulex aquaticus;
the intestines appeared of different colours, as brown, yellow,

sometime bent, as in the drawing, the others, both when in motion

<p>Previous to the publication of Mr. Adams&#8217;s edition, a friend communicated to him drawings

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Having in this and the preceding chapter described an extensive
variety of those minute and wonderful productions of nature,
the hydr&aelig;, vorticell&aelig;, and animalcula infusoria, I shall take my
leave of the subject with remarking, that though by the assistance
of the microscope myriads of animated beings, roving in the
smallest drop of water as if it were a sea, have been exhibited to
the astonished eyes of attentive observers, it surely cannot be
deemed an unreasonable supposition, that the <span class="smcap">Adorable Creator</span>,
who has filled the immensity of extent with suns and
worlds, has also peopled every particle of fluid with beings far
more minute than any apparatus of ours can perceive; and however
insignificant many of the smaller parts of the creation may
appear to the uninformed bulk of mankind, there cannot exist a
doubt, but that they were all, collectively and individually,
formed for the wisest purposes; and, though in many instances
these designations are to us incomprehensible, let us not on
that account rashly withhold our admiration. These sentiments
are beautifully enforced in the following expressive lines of
Thomson:</p>

<h2><span class="chapno">CHAP. IX.</span><br />
<span class="chapname">ON THE ORGANIZATION OR CONSTRUCTION OF TIMBER,
AS VIEWED BY THE MICROSCOPE.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="startcapital">T</span>he subject of the following chapter opens an extensive field
for observation to the naturalist, in which the labour of a life may
be well employed: it is a branch where the observer will find the
microscope of continual use, and without which he will scarce be
able to form any just idea of the organization of trees and plants,
or of the variations in the disposition, the number, nature, and
offices of their several parts.</p>

<p>Vegetables are beautiful and perfect in their kind, wonderful
in their growth, beneficial in their uses. &#8220;Herbs and flowers
may be regarded by some persons as objects of inferior consideration
in philosophy; but every thing must be great which has God
for its author. To him all the parts of nature are equally related:
the flowers of the earth can raise our thoughts up to the Creator
of the world as effectually as the stars of heaven; and, till we
make this use of both, we cannot be said to think properly of
either. All trees and herbs in their place and seasons speak the
same language from the climates of the north to the torrid regions
of the south, and from the winter to the spring and the
harvest, they join their voices in the universal chorus of all created<span class="pagenum" id="Page575">[575]</span>
beings, and to the ear of reason celebrate the wisdom of the
Almighty Creator.&#8221;</p>

<p>Malpighi, Grew, Duhamel, Hill, Bonnet, and De Saussure, are
almost the only writers who have treated on the interior structure
of vegetables; and, if we consider the imperfection of the instruments
used by some of them in these anatomical researches, and
the little attention paid by the rest to the advantages their favourite
pursuits might have derived from the use of the microscope,
as well as the dissecting knife, we find greater cause to wonder
at what has been done, than at what remains to be performed.
To the general inattention to the structure of plants, we may,
amongst other causes, also ascribe the instability and fluctuation
of the different theories on the principles of vegetation. We are,
however, so little acquainted with the steps which Providence
takes to lead intellectual, but free agents, to the knowledge of
truth, and the various difficulties, errors, and prejudices, necessary
to be removed, before it can shine in its native colours, that it is
our duty to encourage every humble effort towards the advancement
of science, that thus we may co-operate with our Creator
and Redeemer in promoting that vast plan to which all things are
now converging, the bringing all his creatures to a state of truth,
goodness, and consequent happiness, an end worthy of the best
and wisest of beings.<a href="#Footnote129" id="FNanchor129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote129"><a href="#FNanchor129" class="label">[129]</a> See the
Bishop of Exeter&#8217;s Sermon before the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>As Dr. Hill is the first writer who has treated this part of natural
history in an orderly and scientific manner, I shall use the
names he has adopted for characterizing the different parts of
trees, &amp;c. which are, 1. the rind; 2. the bark; 3. the blea; 4. the
wood; 5. the corona or circle of propagation; 6. the pith. These
are placed immediately within or under one another; they are the
essential parts upon which the strength of the tree depends: in,<span class="pagenum" id="Page576">[576]</span>
among, and between these, the various vessels are placed, which
nourish the whole, and maintain and carry on the vegetation of
the tree, and from which it obtains its peculiar qualities and virtues.
These vessels are of five kinds:</p>

<table class="dontwrap" summary="Vessels">

<tr>
<td class="right padr1">1.</td>
<td class="left padr1">The Exterior</td>
<td rowspan="3" class="brace bt br bb">&nbsp;</td>
<td rowspan="3" class="brace padl0">-</td>
<td rowspan="3" class="left padl1">Juice Vessels.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="right padr1">2.</td>
<td class="left padr1">The Interior</td>

<td class="left padr1">The Intimate</td>

<td colspan="4" class="left padr0">The Sap Vessels.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="right padr1">5.</td>
<td colspan="4" class="left padr0">The Coronal.</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>Of these, the first are placed between the rind and bark; the
second, in the substance of the bark; the third, in the substance
of the blea; the fourth, in the substance of the wood; the fifth,
in the corona.</p>

<p>More accurate instruments, or a more minute investigation of
the parts, may probably discover new vessels in a system which
appears to be entirely vascular, and brings us more thoroughly
acquainted with the nature of vegetation.</p>

<h3>OF THE RIND.</h3>

<p>The exterior covering of all trees is a thin, dry, parched substance,
which has been compared by many writers to the skin of
animals, and called by names analogous thereto; thus it is called
the epidermis by Duhamel, the skin by Grew, the rind by Hill.</p>

<p>When a tree is full of sap, this membrane may be easily detached
from the part it covers; it may be separated from green
branches which are not in sap, by boiling them in water; large
pieces of it may also be obtained from rotten branches; the rind
of the leaves of many trees is detached with singular dexterity
from the other parts, by some of the mining caterpillars; artificial<span class="pagenum" id="Page577">[577]</span>
methods for effecting this purpose have been described in
<a href="#Page160">page 160</a> of this work. Though the rind may at first sight be
thought to be of little use, it will be found to be a principal
organ in the process of vegetation. The part which covers the
root has the most important offices assigned to it.</p>

<p>Many are of opinion that the rind is formed of dried vesicul&aelig;;
and Malpighi says, that we may see in the vascular texture of the
bark of the cherry and plumb-trees an arrangement of the parts
proper to form the rind, and this arrangement is occasioned by
the endeavour of the vascular part to extend itself to the circumference,
and the resistance it meets with from the rind; and that
hence the vessels are flattened, and assume a membranaceous
form.</p>

<p>The rind is a general covering to the young trunks of trees, to
the branches, the roots, the leaves, the fruit, the flowers, &amp;c.
Upon the trunks of large trees some pieces only of the rind are
to be found, having probably been broken by the increased size of
the tree. The rind of some species of trees will bear being
stretched much further than those of others, and remain for a
considerable time uniformly spread over the bark. Du Hamel
asserts, that the rind of vigorous healthy, trees remains longer
whole than on those that are more languid, notwithstanding that
the growth of the last is slower, and therefore makes less efforts
against the rind. This circumstance is much in favour of the
distinct organization of the rind, and against the opinion of those
who only suppose it to consist of dried bladders.</p>

<p>Thin as the rind is, it is formed of many coats, adhering closely
to each other, which in some species may be separated with ease,
in others, with difficulty. Du Hamel says, that he has divided the
rind of the birch into six distinct coats, and that he had no doubt<span class="pagenum" id="Page578">[578]</span>
but what the division might have been carried much further.
Dr. Hill says, that unless some of these coats be obtained in a
state of separation from the rest, the true construction of the rind
cannot be discovered, for the connection and form of the parts
are lost by the confusion in which they appear while they lie one
upon another.</p>

<p>The following experiments may throw a little light upon this
obscure subject.<a href="#Footnote130" id="FNanchor130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> All the rind was taken from the trunk of a
cherry-tree, and the tree thus skinned exposed to the air; a part
of the bark which was next to the rind dried up and exfoliated;
the part next to this did the same; after two or three exfoliations,
a farinaceous substance covered the superfice of the trunk, soon
after which a new rind appeared. Some pieces of rind were
taken from a few young branches, and the wounds were covered
with a cloth that had been soaked in wax and turpentine; on
these the rind appeared in a very little time, without any apparent
exfoliation. From some other branches, not only the rind, but a
part of the bark was also taken away, and the wounds covered
as before; a slight exfoliation was observed here, which was soon
followed with a new rind. The bark was taken entirely off from
a vigorous cherry-tree, while it was in full sap, so that the wood
appeared the whole extent of the trunk. This was protected
from the rays of the sun, and from the air. A new bark and rind
formed themselves upon the trunk, but they did not originate
from the bark that was left on the branches and the root, but
extended from different spots, which were first formed at considerable
distances from each other. After a lapse of fifteen years,
this new rind did not appear like the natural rind of the cherry-tree.
From these experiments we learn, that the rind regenerates
more readily in some cases than in others, and that it preserves<span class="pagenum" id="Page579">[579]</span>
and prevents in a degree the bark from becoming dry too soon,
and in consequence thereof exfoliating.</p>

<div class="footnote">

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Aided by the microscope, a number of luminous points may be
discovered in the rind;<a href="#Footnote131" id="FNanchor131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> these are so many minute holes for other
purposes of transpiration. In the cane these holes are visible to
the naked eye. A few oval holes may also be perceived in it;
these are, however, no more than a separation of the parts, occasioned
by the extension of the vasa interiora.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote131"><a href="#FNanchor131" class="label">[131]</a> Du Hamel Physique des Arbres, tom. 1, p. 9.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Dr. Grew supposed the rind to be formed of small vesicles, or
bladders, clustered together, and intermixed with ligneous fibres
or vessels, which run through the length of the rind; these are
conjoined by other transverse ones, but that as the rind dries, the
bladders or blebs shrink up and disappear. This account does
not differ much from that of Dr. Hill, who says, that the rind is
formed of a series of longitudinal vessels, and a filmy substance,
between them, which, when viewed in a transverse section, form
small circles, the sides of which are supported and made up of
these longitudinal fibres; that the transverse vessels are only a
deception, occasioned by the spaces between them and part of the
film. The mode of obtaining an accurate view of the organization
of this part, by conveying coloured liquors into the several
vessels thereof, has been already described in <a href="#Page160">page 160</a> of these
Essays; by these means, together with the microscope, we find
that the vessels are everywhere pierced with small dots or openings:
of the use of these, the following conjectures have been
formed.<a href="#Footnote132" id="FNanchor132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote132"><a href="#FNanchor132" class="label">[132]</a> Hill&#8217;s Construction of Timber, &amp;c. p. 37.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The root, which is equal in surface to a third part of the tree
above ground, is covered with a pierced rind. The cold of<span class="pagenum" id="Page580">[580]</span>
winter contracts the whole of this, the parts are drawn closer
together, and the mouths of these innumerable vessels are shut or
nearly so, by this contraction; a very little of the half-congealed
moisture of the ground gets into them, but this suffices for the
service of the tree, when there is little heat to cause any perspiration,
and at a time when in the deciduous trees, the very organs
of the greatest perspiration, the leaves, do not exist.</p>

<p>The warmth of the spring arrives, the fluids of the earth grow
thinner, every part of the root expands; this opens the mouths of
the vessels, and the torrent of nutrition rushes in. By these
means, every coat of the rind, and the interstitial spaces thereof,
are rendered supple, and may be easily separated from the under
coverings.</p>

<p>In roots, the colour of the rind varies very much, being white
in some, brown in others, &amp;c. Every root, according to Grew,
after it has arrived at a certain age, has a double skin, the one
coeval with the other parts, and exists in the seed; a ring is afterwards
sent off from the bark, which forms the second skin; thus
in the root of dandelion, towards the end of May, the original or
outer skin appears shrivelled, and is easily separated from the new
one, which is fresher, and adheres more firmly to the bark. Perennial
plants are supplied in this manner with a new skin every
year; the outer one always falls off in the autumn and winter,
and a new one is formed from the bark in the succeeding spring.</p>

<h3>OF THE VESSELS WHICH ARE CONTAINED BETWEEN THE
RIND AND THE BARK.</h3>

<p>These are called by Du Hamel the cellular coat, enveloppe
cellulaire; by Hill, the exterior vessels, and the vasa propria exteriora.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page581">[581]</span></p>

<p>It has been already observed, that in trees the juice vessels, or
vasa propria, do not form those constituent parts of the wood of
which the timber consists, but that it is from the nature of these
recipient vessels that it derives its virtues, qualities, and specific
properties.<a href="#Footnote133" id="FNanchor133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> A tree may grow, live, and give shade without
them; but on those its peculiar character and decided virtues depend;
these are greatest where the vasa propria are largest or
most numerous; and where we do not find these, we scarce find
any thing that will affect the taste or the smell. There are different
ranges of these vessels between the several parts, each of
which has its allotted place, its peculiar form, its different structure,
and its separate use. Many trees have them in all their
parts, others only in some of them, while others do not exhibit
any.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote133"><a href="#FNanchor133" class="label">[133]</a> Hill&#8217;s Construction of Timber, p. 73.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>On taking off the rind, we find a substance of a deep green
colour, succulent and herbaceous, formed of a prodigious number
of filaments interwoven together in various directions; it is more
abundant in some trees than in others, particularly in the elder,
and more succulent in summer than in winter; it is then also
less adherent to the rind. Dr. Hill thinks the best time of separating
the rind, in order to view this part, is in a living branch,
at the time of its swelling for the spring, or for the midsummer
shoot, but much easier by the means of maceration.<a href="#Footnote134" id="FNanchor134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote134"><a href="#FNanchor134" class="label">[134]</a> Hill&#8217;s Construction of Timber, p. 75.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>When the rind is perfectly separated, it leaves the vasa propria
of this class behind it; they scarce adhere to the inner bark, and
but little to the rind; they are disposed in packets, and do not
run straight down the branch, but interweaving with each other,
form a kind of net. These packets may be separated easily from
the bark; when a thin transverse section of one of them is examined,<span class="pagenum" id="Page582">[582]</span>
it is found to be composed of twelve or fifteen distinct
vessels with hard rinds. Dr. Hill says, that with a great deal of
patience, a vast number of objects, and a good microscope, we
may see by what means these vessels adhere to the bark; for we
shall find upon the sides small oval depressions which fit thereto,
and that are probably a kind of glands, that separate from the
general store of sap, with which the bark is filled, the juices peculiar
to these vessels.</p>

<h3>OF THE BARK.</h3>

<p>The bark lies next within the rind, and differs but little from it
in construction, though it holds a more important office in the
scale of vegetation, the growth and qualities of the tree being in
a great measure connected with it. It is, therefore, found to
differ considerably in substance, quantity, and quality, in various
kinds.</p>

<p>It is originally the outer membrane, covering the lobes of the
seed. Even there, as in the branch of a tree, it appears in the
form of a kind of spunge, or like a crust of bread, composed of
flatted bladders.</p>

<p>Its spunge-like nature may be further inferred from the contraction
of its pores when dry, and the ease with which they
dilate when in water. Grew has called it a most curious and
exquisitely fine, wrought spunge. In the course of its growth,
the outer ranges of these bladders drying, it becomes what we
call the rind; for the rind was once bark, and has only suffered a
slight change in separating from it.</p>

<p>By the bark the tree is fed with a continual supply of moisture,
protected from external injuries, and defended from the excesses<span class="pagenum" id="Page583">[583]</span>
of heat and cold; for these purposes it is variously disposed in different
trees. In the hardy and slow growing, as the oak and chesnut,
it is thin; in the quick growing, as willow, poplar, and the
like, it is thick. And what is more particularly to be attended to is,
that in some its inner verge is radiated. There are some trees, and
a great many herbaceous plants, in which this part is continued
inward, in form of rays, through the blea into the wood, and seems
to form so many green wedges, that split as it were the substance
of both those parts;<a href="#Footnote135" id="FNanchor135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> a circumstance which accounts for the vegetation
of some particular trees, which are known to live when
deprived of the bark; because they have rays of the same substance
within which answer the purpose, and this in a degree
answering to the nature of their life.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The bark appears to be formed, first, of longitudinal fibres,
which Du Hamel considers as so many lymphatic vessels; secondly,
by a sort of a filmy cellular tissue, which has been
considered as a kind of bladders by some, or as parenchymatous
by others; thirdly, of the vasa propria interiora, or interior juice
vessels.</p>

<p>The longitudinal fibres are disposed in strata, which lie one
over the other. In that stratum which is next the rind, or rather
the cellular coat, we perceive a net of longitudinal fibres, the
meshes of which are large and easily distinguished, particularly
when the cellular tissue that fills up the interstices is removed.
To do this, the branches should be macerated for a considerable
time; some require to be kept in this state for years. It will
then be easy to separate first the rind, then the cellular coating,
and afterwards this pulpy matter. It may sometimes be easily
removed after the branches have been boiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page584">[584]</span></p>

<p>The most exterior stratum, when examined by the naked eye,
seems to be formed of simple fibres, which graft, solder, or inosculate
one with the other; but when examined by a microscope,
each of these fibres will be found to be a bundle of filaments,
which may be easily separated from each other.</p>

<p>Grew says, that each filament, like the nerves in animals, consists
of twenty or thirty small contiguous tubes, which run uniformly
from the extremity of the root, without sending off any
branches, or suffering any change in their size and shape. Hence
the bark may be torn or divided lengthwise, with greater ease
than in an horizontal direction; when macerated, they are capable
of a very great degree of subdivision.</p>

<p>The filaments of a cortical vessel are to be looked on, agreeable
to what we have already observed, as so many little bundles
placed near together, and at first growing parallel to each other;
but soon quitting this direction, the filaments of one fascicle
parting from that to which they originally belonged, and inclining
more or less obliquely towards another, sometimes uniting
with it, at others, bending backwards, and uniting again with
that from which it proceeded, or with some one that it meets
with. In this manner new fascicles are often formed, while
other parcels are increased or diminished by the additions of new
filaments; by these means, a kind of irregular net is formed, and
the fibres proceed in a serpentine line from the top to the bottom
of the tree.</p>

<p>The thickness of the bark is entirely formed of strata of these
longitudinal fibres, which lie one over the other; each of these
strata is similar to the exterior one, only the meshes are smaller,
and the fibres finer, in proportion as they are more interior,<span class="pagenum" id="Page585">[585]</span>
insomuch that at last the meshes are almost annihilated, and the
fibres seem to lie quite parallel to each other.</p>

<p>There are some trees, however, where the meshes are not visible,
and in which the fibres lie quite in a straight direction.
There are many other circumstances in which they vary in different
trees; in some the meshes of each stratum correspond with
each other, diminishing gradually in size as they are more interior,
and forming as it were so many conical cells.</p>

<p>We may, I think, conclude from what has been said, that the
bark is composed of several thin membranes, which extend over
the whole exterior surface of the tree. The most exterior membrane
is the rind; under this is what Du Hamel calls the cellular
coat; next to this the cortical stratum or true bark of the tree,
which is formed of lymphatic vessels ranged more or less in a
reticular form, and of the vasa propria interiora. The meshes
are so constituted as to form large cavities next the rind, and
small ones near the wood. These cavities are filled with a parenchymatous
substance or the cellular tissue, which being continued
from the wood to the rind, joins and unites the cortical
stratum, and afterwards spreading on the outside thereof, forms
what has been termed the cellular coat.</p>

<h3>OF THE CELLULAR TISSUE.</h3>

<p>We now proceed to give some account of the substance which
fills up the vacant spaces that are left between the longitudinal
fibres. It is called by Grew the parenchyma or pulp, by Malpighi,
the vesicular tissue or web; both of them consider it as
formed of small bladders or reticles, that are in contact with
each other, lying in an horizontal position, or at right angles to
the longitudinal fibres: they do not suppose them to be all of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page586">[586]</span>
same size, or even of the same figure: Grew compares it to the
froth of beer or eggs. The flesh of fruits consists for the most
part of this substance, very much filled with juice, though with
considerable difference in its organization. Be this as it may,
the nature of this substance, its form and structure, are at present
but very little known. It is floccose, and varies in colour in
different species.</p>

<h3>OF THE VASA PROPRIA INTERIORA.</h3>

<p>Besides the lymphatic vessels and the cellular substance, we
find the juice vessels, or vasa propria, in the bark. In those trees
which are famous for medicinal virtues, they are usually very
large; they carry the milky juices of the sumach, and in them is
lodged the finest and highest-flavoured turpentine in all the kinds
of pine. Dr. Hill thinks that a tree of that genus exhibits them
best, and the more, as the turpentine which fills them may be
perfectly dissolved in spirit of wine. The pinus orientalis is the
species in which these vessels are most distinctly seen.</p>

<h3>OF THE BLEA.</h3>

<p>This is that part of the tree which is formed into wood, and
therefore lies between it and the bark, and may be separated from
them by maceration.</p>

<p>A longitudinal piece of the blea, when examined by the microscope,
exhibits a number of vessels running parallel to each
other, the interstitial spaces being filled with a floccose, white,
formless substance, of which Dr. Hill suspects even the vessels
themselves to be formed. Innumerable small openings or mouths
may be discovered in these vessels, suited to imbibe the moisture
which is so essential to the life and health of plants. These<span class="pagenum" id="Page587">[587]</span>
mouths cannot be well discerned, except when they are opened
by the season of the year, either before the first leaves of spring,
or in the midsummer shooting time; though a small quantity of
moisture will keep them open at that time, yet no quantity would
be sufficient at an improper season.<a href="#Footnote136" id="FNanchor136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote136"><a href="#FNanchor136" class="label">[136]</a> Hill&#8217;s Construction of Timber, p. 47.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The blea is a zone more or less perfect, which lies under the
bark, and covers or surrounds the wood, and is principally distinguished
from it by being less dense. In some species the difference
between the blea and the wood is very remarkable, in
others it is less so.</p>

<p>The ancient botanists, struck with the difference they observed
between the wood and the blea, compared this substance to the
fat in animals. Malpighi, Grew, and Du Hamel considered it as
the wood not yet arrived to a state of perfection. It is organized
in a manner similar to the wood, and possessing the same vessels
disposed nearly in the same manner. The juice vessels of this
part may be separated from it by maceration; Dr. Hill says, that
in this state they appear perfect cylinders, with thick white coats,
the surface perfectly uniform.</p>

<h3>OF THE WOOD.</h3>

<p>When the bark and the blea are taken away, we come to the
wood, which is a solid substance, on which the strength of the
tree depends, and which has been considered by naturalists as
being to the tree what bones are to the animal. The wood, in
a general view may be considered as formed of strata, which are
inclosed one within the other; these strata consist of ligneous
fibres or lymphatic vessels, the cellular web or tissue, vasa propria,<span class="pagenum" id="Page588">[588]</span>
and what have been called the air vessels. It is more difficult
to investigate the construction of the wood than that of the
other parts, because the texture is in general much harder, and
therefore not so easily separated, requiring very long macerations,
and many subjects, before one may be found fit for examination.</p>

<p>If a transverse section of almost any kind of wood be examined,
we shall perceive these strata very clearly and sensibly distinguished
from one another. It has been generally supposed that
each of these is the product of one year&#8217;s growth; though, if we
cut the same wood obliquely, it will be found that each of these
strata is compounded of smaller ones, which are therefore not so
easy to discover as the larger. By macerating rotten pieces of
trees, the wood may be divided into an immense number of
leaves or strata, thinner than the finest paper.</p>

<p>If the foregoing strata be examined in their detached state by
the microscope, we shall find them to be composed of longitudinal
fibres; some pieces of rotten wood, after maceration, will
divide of themselves into very fine longitudinal fibres; the existence
of these is further proved by the facility with which wood
may be split in the direction of these fibres. From hence we
may collect, that the ligneous strata are formed of small fibres or
vessels, collected together in fascicles, like the bark: in some
trees they are parallel to each other, in others they are disposed
more obliquely, crossing and forming an irregular kind of network.
There is great probability that this reticular disposition
exists in all trees, though it may be difficult to discover it in
many on account of the fineness of the meshes, the hardness of the
wood, and the sameness of colour in the constituent fibres.</p>

<p>We are here only speaking of the lymphatic vessels or ligneous
fibres of the wood, which exist in it as well as in the bark,<span class="pagenum" id="Page589">[589]</span>
though in different states; for the ligneous fibres are always
harder and less flexible than the cortical ones. Malpighi thinks
they differ in another particular, namely, that a juice or fluid
issues from the cortical fibres, while none is found in those of the
wood. In this it would appear from the observations of Du Hamel,
that he was mistaken.</p>

<p>A transverse section of wood generally appears formed of a
number of rays proceeding from the corona to the bark, which
are intersected at different distances by concentric circles, interspersed
with vessels of varying magnitude: the variations in this
structure afford much pleasure to the curious observer, and throw
considerable light upon the nature and properties of timber; for
it is by means of a variety of strainers that different juices are
prepared from the same mass. Matter, considered as matter, has
no share in the qualities of bodies. It is from the arrangement
of it, or the recipient forms given to it, that we have so many
different substances. According to the modifications that these
receive, we shall find the same light, air, water, and earth, manifesting
themselves in one by a deadly poison, and in another by
the most salubrious food. A lemon ingrafted upon an orange
stock, is capable of changing the sap of the orange into its own
nature, by a different arrangement of the nutritive juices. One
mass of earth will give life and vigour to the bitter aloe, to the
sweet cane, the cool house-leek, and the fiery mustard, the nourishing
grain, and the deadly night-shade.</p>

<p>The wood may be considered as composed of two parts, ligneous
and parenchymatous. The former has already been treated
of; the latter is that which is disposed into rays, running as it
were between the ligneous fibres, and interweaving with them;
it originates either with the pith or corona. There is a very
great diversity in these radial insertions; in some trees there are<span class="pagenum" id="Page590">[590]</span>
very few, while they abound in others; in some they are very
fine, in others very thick. In texture, they seem similar to the
blebs of the bark, only that here they are so crowded and stretched
out as to appear like parallel threads, somewhat similar to a net
when drawn tight.</p>

<h3>OF THE CORONA.</h3>

<p>Dr. Hill gives this name to that circle which surrounds the pith,
and separates it from the wood; although in his opinion it differs
greatly from both, and in its composition has no resemblance to
either. It is, according to him, the most important part in the
whole vegetable fabric, by which the propagation and increase of
the branches, buds, and shoots, are carried on.<a href="#Footnote137" id="FNanchor137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote137"><a href="#FNanchor137" class="label">[137]</a> Hill on the Construction of Timber, p. 55.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>It has been usual to suppose the pith of vegetables to be the
part in which these wonderful sources of increase reside, but this
is not the case; and he asserts, that so far from being prior to the
other parts, it is in reality posterior to some of them in the time
of its formation.</p>

<p>The corona is not so uniform as the other parts, nor is it constituted
exactly similar in all trees. It is placed between the pith
and wood in all vegetables, forming a ring, whose outline is more
or less regulated. The general circle is cellular, composed of
blebs and vessels, like the bark and the rind, and is perfectly similar
to them, only that at different distances oblong clusters of
different vessels are placed amongst it. These clusters are usually
eight or ten in number, and give origin to the angles of the
corona. They are not uniform, or of one kind of vessels, as in
the bark, but each has two distinct sorts, the exterior one answering<span class="pagenum" id="Page591">[591]</span>
to the blea, and the interior, to the wood of trees; and
within each of these are disposed vessels not unlike those in the
blea and wood, though often larger than they are found in those
parts.</p>

<p>Thus each cluster is composed of all the essential parts of the
succeeding branch, and the intermediate parts of the circle are
absolutely bark and rind; they are ready to follow and clothe the
cluster when it goes off in the form of a shoot, because it will
then need their covering and defence, though in its present inclosed
state it does not. It is from this construction, that a tree
is ready at all times and in all parts to shoot out branches, and
every branch in the same manner to send out others; for the
whole trunk, and the branch in all its length, have this course of
eight or ten clusters of essential vessels ready to be protruded out,
and the proper and natural integuments as ready to cover them.
In some trees, these parts are more evident, in others more obscurely
arranged. Dr. Hill says, the bocconia, or parrot-wood of
the West-Indies, and the greater celandine, are proper subjects
for opening this great mystery of nature. On the corona and its
clusters depend that property of vegetables, that they can be produced
entire from every piece. These clusters follow the course
of the other portions of the tree; they are therefore everywhere;
they are always capable of growing, and their growth, even in
a cutting of the smallest twig, cannot produce a leaf, or any other
part of a vegetable alone, but must afford the whole; for they
are complete bodies, and the whole is there waiting only for the
opportunity of extension, by obtaining sufficient nourishment.
For the knowledge we have of this part we are altogether indebted
to Dr. Hill. It remains for future observers to confirm,
or disprove his observations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page592">[592]</span></p>

<h3>OF THE PITH.</h3>

<p>The pith is found in the center of every young shoot of a tree;
it is large in some, less in others, but present in all. It is placed
close within the corona.</p>

<p>It seems to be nothing more than a congeries of the cellular
tissue; it is generally found near the center of the tree, inclosed
as it were within a tube; in general, the cells of the pith are
larger than those of the cellular tissue, with which, according to
Du Hamel, it communicates. For the rays which extend from
the pith to the bark are, in his opinion, produced from it. Thus,
though it may differ in name from the parenchymatous parts of
the bark, and the radial insertions in the wood, yet it is of the
same nature and texture, and is continuous with them; so that,
according to this idea, the skin, the parenchyma, the insertions,
and the pith, are all one piece of work, filled up in divers manners
with the vessels.</p>

<p>The bark and the wood grow thicker every year, while the
pith, on the contrary, grows more slender, so that in a branch of
one year it is of a larger size than it is in the same branch when
two years old, and so on. In very young branches, while in an
herbaceous state, the pith forms the greatest part of its substance;
but when the fibres are stronger, the pith becomes less succulent,
and surrounded with a tube of wood; when the branch has arrived
to a certain age, it is so compressed as to be almost annihilated.
In examining different branches that proceed from others
in their first state, a small communication between the pith of
the one and the other will be found; but this communication is
generally entirely closed up in the second or third year.<a href="#Footnote138" id="FNanchor138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
The<span class="pagenum" id="Page593">[593]</span>
cells of which the pith is formed are at first entirely one connected
body; but as the plant grows up, it is often so broken and
ruptured, as to remain no longer a continuous substance.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote138"><a href="#FNanchor138" class="label">[138]</a> Du Hamel Physique des Arbres, tom. 1, p. 38.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>This, as well as many other particulars in the history of the
pith, corroborates the opinion of Dr. Hill,<a href="#Footnote139" id="FNanchor139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> who thinks it is
formed for the purpose of moistening the clusters of the corona,
and regulating its extension; it has been supposed coeval with,
or primordial to all the other parts, but he thinks it is postnate,
and comes after them in the order of time, as well as in its uses;
that exhaled air gives origin to its blebs, and the thickness of the
juices cloathing the bubble, gives it form and substance. The
first season is the time of its greatest use, and it immediately after
begins to decay.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote139"><a href="#FNanchor139" class="label">[139]</a> Hill&#8217;s Construction of Timber, p. 66.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The pith has in general been represented as much more complex
than it really is. It consists of a range of bladders lying
one over the other. The membrane is simple, the outline single;
but as it is very difficult to procure it in this simple state, it is
often seen and represented under a variety of irregular, though
pleasing forms, which are occasioned by the intersections of the
outlines of the blebs, as seen one over another.</p>

<p>A cluster in any part of the corona, protruding itself onward
and outward in the growing season,<a href="#Footnote140" id="FNanchor140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> carries a part of the circle
out with it. The cluster itself is a perfect piece of the wood and
blea, and the bark which follows it out in its progress perfectly
clothes it; thus is the first protrusion of the shoot made, but all
this while there is no pith. The continuation of growth is made
by the extension of all the parts obliquely upwards; in the course<span class="pagenum" id="Page594">[594]</span>
of this extension they hollow themselves into a kind of cylinder,
of the form of the future branch, and by this disposition a small
vacancy is made in their center. This enlarges as they increase,
and as it enlarges it becomes filled with the exudation of those
little bladders which remain and constitute the pith, fed from the
inner coat of the pith, which already begins to form itself into a
new corona. Grew seemed to think, that in some instances the
pith was of posterior growth to the other parts, and derived its
origin from the bark; and that the insertions of the bark running
in between the rays of the wood meet in the center, and constitute
the pith.</p>

<h3>OF THE SAP VESSELS.</h3>

<p>The most numerous and the largest apertures are generally to
be found in the wood, which are perceived very distinctly in a
transverse section, in which the ends of the vessels are seen as
cut through by the knife. The scarlet oak of America is recommended
as a proper object for exhibiting them. If a short cylinder
of a three years branch of this oak, a little macerated, be
hollowed away with a chissel, we shall see what a large portion
of the wood is occupied by these vessels; they are thick and
strong, and it is easy, with some care and attention, to loosen
several of them.</p>

<p>If a number of these thus separated be put into a vial of rain
water, and frequently shook for several days, some will at length
be found perfectly clean; these are then to be put into spirit of
wine, and when that has been two or three times changed, they
will be in a condition to be viewed for understanding their structure;
another method of preparation has already been shewn in
<a href="#Page162">page 162</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page595">[595]</span></p>

<p>These are the vessels which have been called by some writers
air, by others, tracheal vessels. It is, however, to be remarked,
that most of those who have considered them as air vessels, refer
us to the tree while in a more herbaceous state; in this case they
say, that we shall find these parts filled with a fine spiral filament.
As these vessels are often to be found empty, they have been supposed
to answer the purposes of lungs to the plant. Malpighi
asserts, that if they be examined in winter, they often exhibit a
vermicular motion, which astonishes the spectator.</p>

<p>Those who suppose the corona to contain the whole structure
of the tree in miniature, and that it is the embryo of future
shoots, suppose it to contain the vessels proper for each part, a
subject that must be left to the decision of future observers.</p>

<h3>OF THE VASA PROPRIA INTIMA.</h3>

<p>These are the only vessels which remain to be spoken of. They
are large, conspicuous, and important; their natural place is in the
blea, though they are sometimes repeated in the wood and the
corona. Their coats are thicker than those of any other vessels.<a href="#Footnote141" id="FNanchor141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
It is not difficult, after a successful maceration, to separate some
of these vessels from the blea; in this state they appear perfect
cylinders, with thick white coats, of a firm, solid, and uniform
texture.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote141"><a href="#FNanchor141" class="label">[141]</a> Hill&#8217;s Construction of Timber, p. 83 and 85.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>It has generally been supposed, that each of those concentric
circles, which are to be observed in the transverse section of almost
every tree, was the product of one year, or the quantity of
wood added to the tree in that space; here, however, Dr. Hill
differs again from the general opinion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page596">[596]</span></p>

<p>From what has been said, we may deduce the following general
ideas relative to the organization of trees. The most obvious
and remarkable parts of a plant, or tree, are the root, the stem,
the branches, the leaves, the flower, and the fruit. The component
parts of these divisions are not complicated; they are simple
when compared with those of an animal, and this because the
offices of the vegetable are fewer than those of the animal.</p>

<p>The interior part may be considered as consisting of ligneous
fibres, interspersed with a vast number of bladders, which are
here named the cellular tissue, the vasa propria, and the sap
vessels; though these are considered by some writers as mere
air vessels.</p>

<p>The ligneous fibres are very fine tubes, proceeding nearly in a
vertical direction from the top to the bottom of the tree; they
are sometimes parallel to each other, sometimes they divaricate,
and often leave oblong intervals or spaces. There is great reason
for supposing them to be a species of lymphatic vessels. The
vacant spaces between these fibres are filled up by a vesicular
membrane, lying in an horizontal direction, and which is called
in this chapter the cellular tissue.</p>

<p>The vasa propria are formed of ligneous fibres, but differ from
the foregoing in their size, and in the juices which they contain.
In the part properly called the wood, we meet with the sap
vessels; but as in some states they seem as if they were formed
of a silver-coloured spiral membrane, and are found without any
juices, they have been supposed to be air vessels, and called the
trachea, making up an arterial system, and supplying the place of
the heart in animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page597">[597]</span></p>

<p>The interior part of the tree may be further considered as divided
into four principal concentric strata, the bark, the blea,
the wood, and the pith; to these Dr. Hill has added the corona.
Whatever part of a plant is examined, we find these and no
more. The root, its ascending stalk, and descending fibre, are
formed of one, and not three different substances. Thus the
whole vegetable is reduced to one entire body. And what appears
in the flower to be formed of altogether distinct parts, will
be found to originate in these.</p>

<p>The bark, which is the exterior covering of the tree, is divided
into two parts, a thin outer rind, and a much thicker inner one.
The exterior one seems to be little more than a fine film of irregular
meshes, the inner one composed of large blebs, leaving in
some subjects large vacant spaces, which form its vasa propria.
It is made up of several strata lying one over the other.</p>

<p>Next to this is the blea, which is of an uniform structure. It
is an imperfect wood, waiting only for the hand of time to be
brought to perfection. The duration of the blea in this middle
state depends on the internal powers and strength of the tree,
being so much shorter as this is more vigorous.</p>

<p>The wood, including the corona, comes next; it differs in density
and duration both from the blea, the bark, and the wood.
It is made up of strong fibres. The life of the vegetable seems to
reside in it; from it all the other parts are produced. It shoots a
pith inwards, and a blea and a bark outwards.</p>

<p>Every tree may be considered as consisting of numerous concentric
strata or flakes, forming so many cones, inscribed one
within the other, and whose number is almost indefinite. The
most exterior contain the rudiments of the bark; the more interior,<span class="pagenum" id="Page598">[598]</span>
those of the wood. In the germ they are gelatinous, by
degrees they become herbaceous, and in process of time assume
the consistence of wood. Thus the stem, the root and the branch,
may be considered as formed of a prodigious number of concentric
vertical strata, each composed of different fascicles of fibres;
which fibres are again formed of smaller ones. The spaces between
these, and among the fibres, are filled up, interwoven with,
and connected by the cellular tissue, of which the radial insertions
are formed.</p>

<p>The strata harden successively one after the other; the most
interior stratum is that which hardens first; this is then covered
by another which is more ductile and herbaceous, and so on; so
that the bulk of the tree is increased every year by the accession
of an hollow cylinder of wood derived from the internal bark.
From the extension in breadth, the tree acquires bulk; from that
in length it gains its height. The strata gradually diminish in
size as they gain in length; from hence the conical figure of the
root, stem, and branch. All the parts of the plant are the same,
differing in nothing more than in shape and size. The roots are
sharp and pointed, that they may make their way more readily
through the earth. The leaves are broad, that they may more
effectually catch the moisture from the atmosphere, &amp;c. When
the root of a tree is elevated above, instead of being retained
under the earth, it assumes the appearance of a perfect plant,
with leaves and branches. Experiment shews that a young tree
may have its branches placed in the earth, and its roots elevated
in the air, and in that inverted state it will continue to live and
grow. The principal source of the ph&aelig;nomena of vegetation is
the simplicity and uniformity of their organization.</p>

<p>The figures in <a href="#Plate28">Plates XXVIII.</a> <a href="#Plate29">XXIX.</a> and <a href="#Plate30">XXX.</a> are portions

<h2><span class="chapno">CHAP. X.</span><br />
<span class="chapname">OF THE CRYSTALLIZATION OF SALTS, AS SEEN BY THE MICROSCOPE;
TOGETHER WITH A CONCISE LIST OF OBJECTS.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="startcapital">C</span>rystallization, in general, signifies the natural formation
of any substance into a regular figure, resembling that of a
natural crystal. Hence the phrases of the crystallized ores, crystallized
salts, &amp;c. and even the basaltic rocks are now generally
reckoned to be effects of this operation; the term, however, is
most commonly applied to bodies of the saline kind; and their
separation in regular figures from the water, or other fluid in
which they were dissolved, is called their crystallization. If the
word crystallization were to be confined to its most proper sense,
as it seems to have been formerly, it could only be applied to
operations by which certain substances are disposed to pass from
a fluid to a solid state, by the union of their parts, which so
arrange themselves, that they form transparent and regularly-figured
masses, like native crystal; from which resemblance the
word crystallization has evidently been taken.<a href="#Footnote144" id="FNanchor144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote144"><a href="#FNanchor144" class="label">[144]</a> Macquer&#8217;s Dictionary of Chemistry, Art. Crystallization.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>But modern chemists and naturalists have much extended this
expression, and it now signifies a regular arrangement of the parts<span class="pagenum" id="Page601">[601]</span>
of any body which is capable of it, whether the masses so arranged
be transparent or not. Thus opake stones, pyrites, and
minerals when regularly formed, are said to be crystallized, as
well as transparent stones and salts.</p>

<p>The opacity and transparency of substances are justly disregarded,
in considering whether they be crystallized or not; for
these qualities are perfectly indifferent to the regular arrangement
of the integrant parts of substances, which is the essential object
of crystallization.</p>

<p>This being established, crystallization may be defined, an operation
by which the integrant parts of a body, separated from
each other by the interposition of a fluid, are disposed to unite
again, and to form solid, regular, and uniform masses.</p>

<p>To understand as much as we can of the mechanism of crystallization,
we must remark,</p>

<p>1. That the integrant parts of all bodies have a tendency to
each other, by which they approach, unite, and adhere together,
when not prevented by an obstacle.</p>

<p>2. That in bodies simple or little-compounded, this tendency of
integrant parts is more obvious and sensible than in others more
compounded; hence the former are much more disposed to crystallize.</p>

<p>3. That although we do not know the figure of the primitive
integrant molecules of any body, we cannot doubt but that those
of every different body have a constantly uniform and peculiar
figure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page602">[602]</span></p>

<p>4. That these integrant parts cannot have an equal tendency
to unite indiscriminately by any of their sides, but by some preferably
to others, excepting all the sides of an integrant part of a
body be equal and similar; and probably the sides, by which they
tend to unite, are those by which they can touch most extensively
and immediately.</p>

<p>The most general ph&aelig;nomena of crystallization may be conceived
in the following manner:</p>

<p>Let a body be supposed to have its integrant parts separated
from each other by some fluid; if a part of this fluid be taken
away, these integrant parts will approach together: and, as the
quantity of intervening fluid diminishes, they will at last touch
and unite. They may also unite when they come so near to each
other, that their mutual tendency shall be capable of overcoming
the distance betwixt them. If, besides, they have time and liberty
to unite with each other by the sides most disposed to this
union, they will form masses of a figure constantly uniform and
similar. For the same reason, when the interposed fluid is hastily
taken away, so that the integrant parts shall be approximated,
and be brought into contact before they have taken the position
of their natural tendency, then they will join confusedly by such
sides as chance presents to them; they will, in such circumstances,
form solid masses, whose figures will not be determinate,
but irregular and various.</p>

<p>Different salts assume different figures in crystallization, and
are, by these means, easily distinguished from one another. But
besides the large crystals produced in this way, each salt is capable
of producing a very different appearance of the crystalline
kind, when only a drop of the saline solution is made use of, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page603">[603]</span>
the crystallization viewed through a microscope. For our knowledge
of this species of crystallization, we are indebted to Mr.
Henry Baker, who was presented by the Royal Society with a
gold medal for the discovery, in the year 1744. These microscopical
crystals he distinguishes from the larger ones by the name
of configurations; but this term seems inaccurate, and the distinction
may be properly preserved by calling the large ones the
<span class="smcapall">COMMON</span>, and the small ones the <span class="smcapall">MICROSCOPICAL</span>, crystals of
the salt.</p>

<p>It has not yet been shewn by any writer on the subject, why
salts should assume any regular figure, much less why every one
should have a form peculiar to itself. Sir Isaac Newton endeavoured
to account for this, by supposing the particles of salt to
be diffused through the solvent fluid, at equal distances from each
other; and that then the power of the attraction between the
saline particles could not fail to bring them together in regular
figures, as soon as the diminution of heat suffered them to act on
each other. But it is certain some other agent must be concerned
in this operation, besides mere attraction, otherwise all
salts would crystallize in the same manner. Others have, therefore,
had recourse to some kind of polarity in the particles of
each salt, which determined them to arrange themselves in such
a certain form; but unless we give a reason for this polarity, we
only explain crystallization by itself. One thing seems to have
been overlooked by those who have endeavoured to investigate
this subject, namely, that the saline particles do not only attract
one another, but they also attract some part of the water which
dissolves them.</p>

<p>Did they only attract each other, the salt, instead of crystallizing,
would fall to the bottom as a powder; whereas, a saline
crystal is composed of salt and water, as certainly as the body of<span class="pagenum" id="Page604">[604]</span>
an animal is composed of flesh and blood, or a vegetable of solid
matter and sap; if a saline crystal be deprived of its aqueous part,
it will as certainly lose its crystalline form, as if it were deprived
of the saline part. It is, therefore, not improbable, that
crystallization is a species of vegetation, and is accomplished by
the same powers to which the growth of plants and animals is to
be ascribed. Some kinds of crystallization resemble vegetation
so much, that we can scarce avoid attributing them to the same
cause.</p>

<p>It has been imagined, that all the great operations in nature
may be reduced to two principles, those of crystallization and
organization; but that often they are so concealed, as to be invisible.
Hence crystallized substances have been frequently mistaken
for organized ones, and vice versa. They differ, however,
essentially in their growth and origin. Organized beings spring
from a germ, in which all the essential parts are concentrated,
and they grow by intusception; whereas crystallized substances
increase by the successive apposition of certain molecules of a
determined figure, which unite in one common mass. Thus
crystallized beings do not grow, properly speaking, though their
substance is augmented, they are not preformed, but formed
daily.</p>

<p>The ph&aelig;nomena of crystallization have much engaged the attention
of modern chemists, and a vast number of experiments
has been made with a view to determine exactly the different
figures assumed by salts in passing from a fluid to a solid form.
It does not, however, appear, from all that has yet been done,
that any certain rule can be laid down in these cases, as the figure
of saline crystals may be varied by the slightest circumstances.
Thus, sal ammoniac, when prepared by a mixture of pure volatile
alkali with spirit of salt, shoots into crystals resembling feathers;<span class="pagenum" id="Page605">[605]</span>
but if, instead of a pure alkali, we make use of one just distilled
from bones, and containing a great quantity of animal oil, we
shall, after some crystallizations of the feathery kind, obtain the
very same salt in the form of cubes.</p>

<p>Such salts as are sublimeable crystallize not only in the aqueous
way by solution and evaporation, but also by sublimation;
and the difference betwixt the figures of these crystals is often
very remarkable. Thus, sal ammoniac, by sublimation never
exhibits any appearance of feathery crystals, but always forms
cubes or parallelopipeds. This method of crystallizing salts by
sublimation has not as yet been investigated by chemists; nor
indeed does the subject seem capable of investigation without
much trouble, as the least augmentation of the heat beyond the
proper degree would make the crystals run into a solid cake,
while a diminution of it would cause them to fall into powder.
In aqueous solutions, too, the circumstances which determine the
shapes of the crystals are innumerable; and the degree of heat,
the quantity of salt contained in the liquor, nay, the quantity of
the liquor itself, and the various constitutions of the atmosphere
at the time of crystallization, often occasion such differences as
seem quite unaccountable and surprizing.</p>

<p>Mr. Bergman has given a dissertation on the various forms of
crystals; which, he observes, always resemble geometrical figures
more or less regular. Their variety at first appears infinite; but
by a careful examination it will be found, that a great number of
crystals, seemingly very different from each other, may be produced
by the combination of a small number of original figures,
which therefore he thinks may be called primitive. On this
principle he explains the formation of the crystalline gems, as
well as salts.<a href="#Footnote145" id="FNanchor145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page606">[606]</span></p>

<p>It has been already shewn, <a href="#Page163">page 163</a>, how to prepare the various
salts for microscopical observations. The beautiful crystallizations
represented in <a href="#Plate31">Plates XXXI.</a> and <a href="#Plate32">XXXII.</a> were produced
in the manner there described.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate31">Plate XXXI.</a> Fig. 2, exhibits a view of the microscopical crystals
of nitre. These shoot from the edges with very little heat,
in flattish figures, of various lengths, and exceedingly transparent,
the sides nearly parallel, though rather jagged, and tapering to a
point; after a number of these are formed, they often dissolve
under the eye, and disappear entirely; but in a little time new
shoots will push out, and the process go on afresh. Beautiful
ramifications are formed round the edge, and many regular figures
are to be observed in different parts of the drop. Fig. 1 is the
real size of the drop.</p>

<p>Fig. 4 is a drop of distilled verdigrise, as it appeared when
viewed by the microscope. There is a difference in the appearance
from this substance, according as the time of the application
is nearer to, or more distant from that in which the solution was
made. Fig. 3, the size of the drop.</p>

<p>If a drop of distilled verdigrise upon glass be viewed through
the microscope, after the crystallization is completed and the
water evaporated, there remains a substance round the crystallization,
which preserves the original size and shape of the drop
when a liquid; betwixt this verge of the drop and the crystals
fine lines are discernible running from the crystals to the circumference
of the drop, at various angles with the crystals; whatever
direction they take, they are always perfectly straight, and of an
equal thickness throughout. When the drop is viewed through
a light ground, these lines appear dark; but when viewed through<span class="pagenum" id="Page607">[607]</span>
a dark ground, they then shine and appear of the beautiful green
colour natural to the crystals of verdigrise.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate32">Plate XXXII.</a> Fig. 1, represents the microscopical appearance
of the crystals of salt of wormwood. The shootings from the
edges of this solution are often very thick in proportion to their
length, their sides full of notches, the ends generally acute;
many spear-like forms are also to be observed, as well as little
crystals of a variety of figures.</p>

<p>Fig. 2. Salt of amber. The shootings of this salt are highly
entertaining, though the process is very slow; many spicul&aelig; shoot
from the edge towards the middle of the solution, and from the
pointed ends of the spicul&aelig; a great variety of diversified branches
may be observed, variously divided and subdivided, and forming
at last, says Baker, a winter scene of trees without leaves.</p>

<p>Fig. 3. Salt of hartshorn. This salt shoots out from the edge
of the drop into solid, thick, and rather opake figures; from these
it often shoots into branches of a rugged appearance, similar to
those of some species of coral.</p>

<p>Fig. 4 represents the microscopical crystals of sal ammoniac.
These form a most beautiful object in the microscope; a general
idea may be more easily acquired by attentively viewing the
figure here exhibited, than by any verbal description.<a href="#Footnote146" id="FNanchor146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<hr class="topthick" />
<hr class="topthin" />

<p>The short list here presented to the reader must, from the
nature of the subject, be very imperfect; for the whole of the
animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms, with all their numerous
subdivisions, furnish objects for the microscope; and there is
not one of them, that, when properly examined, will not afford
instruction and entertainment to the rational investigator of the
works of creation. The Systema Natur&aelig; of Linn&aelig;us may therefore
be regarded as a catalogue of universals for microscopic observation,
each of which comprehends a variety of particulars.
The list here given can be considered as little more than a directory,
to point out to those who have only begun to study this
part of natural history a few of those objects which merit their
attention, and which, from their beauties, may incite them to
pursue the study with greater ardor.</p>

<h4>OF OPAKE OBJECTS.</h4>

<p>Ores and minerals afford an immense variety of very beautiful
and splendid objects. From amongst these the observer may select
the peacock or coloured copper ore, green crystallized ditto,<span class="pagenum" id="Page609">[609]</span>
lead ore, crystallized ditto, crystals of lead, small grained marcasites,
coloured mundic, cinnabar, native sulphur, needle and other
antimony, moss copper, &amp;c. A mixture of small pieces of ores,
&amp;c. of different kinds, produces a pleasing effect. Sands in general
exhibit something not discoverable with the naked eye.
Sand from the sea-shore is often intermixed with minute shells,
particularly that from Rimini, in Italy. Mr. Walker has published
a specimen of the small microscopic shells which are found
on our own coast. From this work we learn, that there are
shell-fish as small as the minutest insects, and possessed of beauties
of which we can form no conception till we have seen them.
Mr. Walker&#8217;s work is entitled, &#8220;A Collection of the minute and
rare Shells lately discovered in the Sand on the Sea-shore near
Sandwich.&#8221;<a href="#Footnote147" id="FNanchor147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> There is a sand from Africa full of small garnets.
The ketton, or kettering stone, is a pleasing object; when examined
by the microscope, we find the grain of it very different
from that of other stones, being composed of innumerable minute
balls, which barely touch each other, and yet form a substance
much harder than free-stone; the grains are, in general, so firmly
united together at the points of contact, that it is hardly possible
to separate them without breaking one or both of the grains.

publication will be more particularly noticed in the ensuing <a href="#Page629">chapter</a>. <span class="smcap">Edit.</span></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Insects of all kinds, both foreign and domestic, are pleasing
objects; but as the foreign ones are not so easily met with, I
shall mention but a few of them, confining myself principally to
those of this country. Among the exotic insects, none appear
more beautiful in the microscope than the curculio imperialis,
Brazil or diamond beetle; the buprestis ignita, or large beetle
from China; the meloe vesicatorius, Linn. the cantharis or Spanish
fly of the shops; several species of locusts, grasshoppers, &amp;c.<span class="pagenum" id="Page610">[610]</span>
Among the English beetles, we may reckon the scarab&aelig;us auratus
or rose chaffer, scarab&aelig;us nobilis, scarab&aelig;us horticola, silpha
aquatica, cassida nobilis and nebulosa. Coccinella or lady-cow;
of these there are great varieties both in size and colour, some
red and black, others black and red, and some yellow and black.
Chrysomela graminis, chrysomela fastuosa, chrysomela nitidula,
chrysomela sericea, chrysomela melanopa, chrysomela asparagi,
see <a href="#Plate20">Plate XX.</a> Fig. 2. Curculio frumentarius, lapathi, betula,
nucum, scrophularia, argenteus, a beautiful little insect resembling
the diamond beetle, but in miniature; curculio albinus,
very beautiful, but scarce in this country. Leptura aquatica,
these are of various colours, as blue, purple, bronze, and crimson.
Arcuata arietis, very common, and is often called the wasp beetle.
Cicindela campestris, on dry banks. Carabus nitens, found in
Yorkshire, a beautiful insect; many small carabi. Gryllus,
gryllo-talpa or mole cricket, this insect, and the grasshoppers, are
many of them too large to be observed at one view, but the head,
fore and hind feet, elytra, &amp;c. viewed separately, are fine objects.
Cicada sanguinolenta, nervosa, interrupta, notonecta striata, minutissima,
head and claws of the nepa cinerea or water-scorpion,
and the whole variety of cimices or field bugs. The wings of
butterflies and moths; the chrysalis of the common white butterfly
is extremely fine.</p>

<p>I wish it were in my power to invite the reader to consider the
pupa state of these insects, as he would find them interesting in
various points of view. Perhaps the following passage from an
ingenious writer may have this effect.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of these creatures crawl for a time as helpless worms
upon the earth, like ourselves; they then retire into a covering,
which answers the end of a coffin or a sepulchre, wherein they
are invisibly transformed, and come forth in glorious array, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page611">[611]</span>
wings and painted plumes, more like the inhabitants of the heavens
than such worms as they were in their former state. This
transformation is so striking and pleasant an emblem of the present,
the intermediate, and glorified state of man, that people of
the most remote antiquity, when they buried their dead, embalmed
and inclosed them in an artificial covering, so figured and
painted, as to resemble the caterpillar in the intermediate state;
and as Joseph was the first we read of that was embalmed in
Egypt, where this custom prevailed, it was probably of Hebrew
original.&#8221;</p>

<p>The eggs of moths and butterflies, particularly the phal&aelig;na
neustria, see <a href="#Plate10">Plate X.</a> Fig. 1 to 6. The bodies and heads of many
libellul&aelig;.</p>

<p>Many of the ichneumon flies, spheges, and wasps, head of the
hornet, sting of ditto, collectors of the bee, many sorts of musc&aelig;,
or flies with two wings, especially those whose bodies are highly
coloured; acari or ticks; phalangium cancroides, see <a href="#Plate18">Plate XVIII.</a>
Fig. 1 and 6. Some spiders, but the eyes of all; the oniscus or
wood-louse, julus, and scolopendra.</p>

<p>The feathers of peacocks, and many other birds, have a grand
effect when viewed in the opake microscope, as have also some
species of ferns, mosses, and wood cut transversely. Madrepores,
millepores, sponges, corallines, &amp;c. exhibit wonderful appearances
not discernible to the naked eye. Parts of echini or sea
eggs, spines of ditto; these may also be cut transversely to shew
their construction. Minute shells dissected, skin of many species
of fish, particularly the lump-sucker, see <a href="#Plate18">Plate XVIII.</a> Fig. 2.
Sole fish, <a href="#Plate19">Plate XIX.</a> Fig. 5. and the rasp fish from Otaheite;
also the skins of snakes, lizards, guanas, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page612">[612]</span></p>

<p>The exterior form, and even the interior structure of the generality
of vegetable seeds, have been supposed by some so much
alike in the several kinds, and of so little curiosity and beauty in
the whole, that they have scarcely been regarded by the curious;
but when nearly examined with the help of microscopes, they are
found to be worthy of a greater attention; those which appear
most like to one another when viewed by the naked eye, often
proving as different, when thus examined, in their several forms
and characters, as the different genera of any other bodies in the
creation. If their external forms carry all this variety and beauty
about them, their internal structure, when laid open by different
sections, appears yet more admirable.</p>

<p>The seed of the greater maple, which we commonly, but improperly
call the sycamore tree,<a href="#Footnote148" id="FNanchor148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> consists of a pod and its wing;
two of these grow upon a pedicle, with the pods together, which
makes them resemble the body of an insect with its expanded
wings: the wings are finely vasculated, and the pods are winged
with a fine white down resembling silk; this contains a round
compact pellet, covered with a brown membrane that sticks very
closely to it. When this is pulled off, instead of discerning a
kernel, as in other seeds, there appears an entire green plant
folded up in a most surprizing manner. The pedicle of this is
about two-eighths of an inch long, and its seminal leaves of about
six-eighths each; between these the germina of the next pair of
leaves are plainly visible to the naked eye, but with a microscope
they are seen with the greatest beauty and perfection.</p>

<p>The seed of the musk scabious is beautiful in its shape and
structure. The calix or cup which contains the seed is of an
octagonal form, and makes an appearance like a fine vase, having
scallopped edges, and toward the inner part of the edge a white
ruffled membrane. The ribs run down from its mouth, which is
bell-fashioned, and becoming narrower downward, form obtuse
angles by continuing from the bend to form the bottom of the
vase. Between these ribs, down to the beginning of the narrow
part, it is clear, though not wholly transparent, and from thence
to the bottom the ribs are hairy. This vase contains the seed,
wherein appears first its thick body, which runs up with a narrow
neck, till it divides into five spiculated fibres, whose spicul&aelig;
are determined upwards, and are thereby prepared to cause the
seed to recede from any thing that might injure it on being
touched. The bodies of the vases, when first ripe, are of a fine
lemon yellow, but grow by long keeping darker; and the bason
formed by the roots of the minute fibres is of a fine green, but the
fibres themselves of a shining brown, like brown sugar-candy, as
their spines are also.</p>

<p>These, and a number of similar beauties in this part of the
creation, are described at large by Dr. Parsons, in his work entitled,
&#8220;The Microscopic Theatre of Seeds.&#8221;<a href="#Footnote149" id="FNanchor149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Most kinds of
seeds should be prepared for a microscopical examination by steeping
them in warm water till their coats are separated, and their
seminal leaves may then be opened without laceration. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page614">[614]</span>
seeds, while dry, and without any preparation, are of an almost
infinite variety of shapes, and afford a number of pleasing objects
for the microscope.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote149"><a href="#FNanchor149" class="label">[149]</a> This
curious work was published in the year 1745. It was the author&#8217;s intention to
have comprised the whole design in four volumes quarto, but the first volume only appeared.
It contains the etymology, synonyma, and description of the several plants and their flowers,
with an account of their medical virtues, and an explanation of botanical terms. As the work
is in but few hands, and a copy not easy to be procured, I flatter myself that extracts from those
parts containing the microscopical descriptions will form an agreeable addition to these Essays;
which the reader will accordingly meet with in the following <a href="#Page629">chapter</a>. <span class="smcap">Edit.</span></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>One of the most interesting scenes in microscopical botany is
exhibited in mouldiness. Those miniature plants seem to bear
the same relation to the vegetable kingdom that the animalcula
infusoria do to the animal; they were formerly considered as
shapeless and unformed masses, but we now view them with
surprize and pleasure taking their place in the great scale of organized
beings, and presenting us with some of the most striking
characteristics of vegetables.</p>

<h4>OF TRANSPARENT OBJECTS.</h4>

<p>We may select from the elytra, or upper wings of beetles,
many beautiful objects, the construction of these will be found
to differ very much; the membranaceous wings, as in the scarab&aelig;us
solstitialis or small cock-chaffer; blatta Americana or cockroach;
all the grylli, as locusts, grasshoppers, &amp;c. Among the
cicadas, the elytra of the nervosa are the most elegant, the nerves
are elevated, and curiously spotted with brown. The elytra of
the cimices or field bugs, which are a very numerous tribe, afford
a great variety of objects; we may select from these as the most
beautiful the elytra of the cimex baccarum and the cimex striatus,
<a href="#Plate20">Plate XX.</a> Fig. 1. The elytra of the fulgora candelaria, from
China, differ essentially from all others.</p>

<p>The under or more transparent wings of beetles excite our attention
even more than the upper or crustaceous ones; for whether
we consider the delicacy of their texture, the great weight
that many of them are calculated to sustain in the air, or the very
curious manner in which they fold them up under the upper case,<span class="pagenum" id="Page615">[615]</span>
their mechanism must astonish and delight us; no two genera
will be found alike, though every individual of the same genus
will be exact. The wing of the forficula auricularia or earwig,
<a href="#Plate14">Plate XIV.</a> is an elegant specimen of the manner of their folding;
this wing folds under a case not one-eighth of its size.</p>

<p>The under wing of the blatta orientalis, or beetle common in
most kitchens, appears to unite the elytra and transparent wings,
partaking in some degree of both.</p>

<p>Among the membranaceous or more transparent winged insects,
the variety is endless, each genus differing essentially from
the other; some appearing full of membranes or nerves, curiously
disposed; others, again, with scarce any, like a clear piece of talc
or isinglass; some exhibit a curious ground-work of points, which
on close examination prove short hairs, while the nerves of others
are furnished with little scales or feathers, as in some species of
the gnat. The wings of many musc&aelig; are coloured with black,
brown, and white, in clouds, spots, stripes, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>The libellul&aelig; or dragon-flies alone afford a great variety, not
only in form but colour; these are all furnished with numerous
and very strong nerves, adapted to the velocity of their flight.
The wings of the ephemera or may-flies, are much more delicate,
these flies rest with their wings erect. The phrygane&aelig; differ
very much from the foregoing, and also from one another; their
under wings fold, and their upper ones are of a stronger texture,
many of them so much resembling small moths as not easily to
be distinguished from them: these are all found in the vicinity of
ponds and marshy places. In the hemerobii a wonderful degree
of elegance is exhibited in the disposition of the nerves which
compose their wings, each nerve being adorned with hair in a
beautiful manner; there are many species of these flies equally<span class="pagenum" id="Page616">[616]</span>
beautiful, a specimen is given in <a href="#Plate15">Plate XV.</a> The ichneumon fly
has four transparent wings, the inferior ones smaller, and more
delicate than the superior; the tube through which the female
deposits its eggs is an additional object well worth attention.
The wings of wasps are folded longitudinally; the wings of the
large bee are very curious. Gnats in general, and the various
species of tipul&aelig;, together with the clouded and variegated wings
of the musc&aelig;, tabani, &amp;c. increase the catalogue beyond the
power of enumeration; in short, there is not a wing but has its
particular beauties, and will amply repay the attentive observer.
The currant sphinx moth connects the transparent and farinaceous
wings, partaking of both; the white plumed, and many-plumed
moths, exhibit wings totally different from all the rest;
many other small moths furnish wings sufficiently transparent for
observation, the fringe or edges being remarkably beautiful.</p>

<h4>OF THE PULEX IRRITANS, OR COMMON FLEA.</h4>

<p>Many small insects that are not too opake, may be viewed and
examined as transparent objects; some of these having been particularly
noticed by the early microscopic writers, it will be necessary
to enumerate a few of them, as without it the work
might be deemed incomplete. Every one is acquainted with the
agility and blood-thirsty disposition of the flea, of the caution
with which it comes to the attack, and the readiness with which
it avoids pursuit. It belongs to the class aptera, has two eyes,
six feet particularly constructed for leaping, the antenn&aelig; or
feelers are filiform, or rather moniliform; the rostrum is inflected,
setaceous, and armed with a sting; the belly is compressed.
This creature is produced from eggs, which it deposits on the
animals that afford it food, or affixes them to the wool of blankets,
rugs, &amp;c. These eggs in about a week are hatched into
small larv&aelig; or worms, which are of a whitish colour, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page617">[617]</span>
slight tinge of reddish, and adhere closely to the body of the
animal, or other substance on which they are produced; in a fortnight
they come to a tolerable size, and are very lively and active;
but if they be touched, they roll themselves up in a ball. At this
period they prepare themselves for their pupa or chrysalis state,
by inclosing themselves in a loosely-spun web, or diffused envelopement
of a very soft, silky, or rather cotton-like appearance,
and of a white colour. In this the larva changes into a chrysalis,
out of which in about twelve days emerges the animal in its perfect
state, armed with powers to disturb the peace of an emperor,
and occasion uneasy sensations in the fairest bosom.<a href="#Footnote150" id="FNanchor150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote150"><a href="#FNanchor150" class="label">[150]</a> Notwithstanding
the inconveniences attending this little insect, and the general disapprobation
which its frequent intrusion occasions, there is something pleasing in the appearance of
the flea; all its motions are elegant, and all its postures indicate agility. The shelly armour
in which it is enveloped, is in a state of perpetual cleanliness; while the muscular power which
it is capable of exerting is so extraordinary, as justly to excite our wonder at so much strength
confined, and concentrated as it were, in so small a space.</p>

<p>The flea, like many other insects, is eminent for its powers of revivescence, and will frequently
recover after being placed in situations very unfavourable to animal life. Some of the
coleopterous insects are, however, capable of exhibiting far more striking examples of suspended
animation. Nat. Misc. vol. v. <span class="smcap">Edit.</span></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>It is difficult to obtain such a view of the flea, as will display
the mechanism and apparatus belonging to the head; these parts
are but imperfectly represented in the celebrated drawing of Dr.
Hooke in his Micrographia. The neck is long, finely arched, and
much resembles the tail of a lobster; the body is covered all over
with a polished suit of sable armour, formed of a hard shelly substance,
curiously jointed and folded over one another, and yet
yielding to all the nimble motions of the little animal; the edges
of the scales are curiously set with short spikes or hairs: it has
two sharp eyes to look before it leaps, for which purpose its legs
are excellently adapted, having three large joints in each, besides
several smaller ones. These joints are so contrived, that it can<span class="pagenum" id="Page618">[618]</span>
as it were fold them up one within another; in leaping, they all
spring at once, and the whole strength of the insect is exerted.
The flexure of the fore legs is forward, that of the hind legs
backward. They are all very hairy, and terminated by two
long hooked sharp claws; the two fore legs are placed very near
the neck, and often conceal the proboscis from our view, the
other four join all at the breast: the proboscis or sucker with
which it penetrates the skin, is placed at the end of the snout,
and is not easily seen except the two fore legs are first removed;
in it are included a couple of darts or lancets, which, after the
proboscis has made an entrance, are thrust farther into the flesh,
and make the blood flow from the adjacent parts, occasioning
that round red spot, with a hole in the center of it, called a
flea-bite.</p>

<h4>OF THE CIMEX LECTULARIUS, OR BED BUG.</h4>

<p>Various are the antipathies of mankind, but all appear to unite
in their dislike to this animal and the louse, and to detest them as
their natural and nauseous enemies. The bug &#8220;intrudes upon
the peace of mankind, and often banishes that sleep which even
anxiety and sorrow permitted to approach: the night is the season
when the bed bug issues from its retreat to make its depredations;
by day it lurks in the most secret parts of the bed, takes
the advantage of every chink and cranny to make a secure lodgement,
and contrives its habitation with so much art, that scarce
any industry can discover its retreat; but when darkness promises
security, it then issues from every corner of the bed, drops from
the tester, and crawls from behind the arras, and travels to the
unhappy patient, who vainly wishes for rest and refreshment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Linn&aelig;us is of opinion that this insect is not originally of European
growth, but was imported from some other country. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page619">[619]</span>
not only disagreeable on account of the extremely offensive smell
proceeding from it, but also because of the rapidity with which it
increases, and the voraciousness of its appetite. It has two
brown small prominent eyes, two antenn&aelig;, and a crooked proboscis,
which lies close under the breast. Instead of wings, we
find on the first ring of the belly two flat pieces which entirely
cover it, and extend towards the sides. These plates, the trunk,
and the head, are amply set with hairs. The proboscis is divided
transversely into four parts, which are probably so many articulations;
this piece is best seen on the under side of the bug, being
bent flat on the belly, and reaching half way down the body; but
the mechanism of this, as well as other parts of these minute insects,
cannot be perfectly understood, but by an accurate examination
with the microscope. It has six legs, each of which has
three joints; these legs, like those of the fly, are formed for running,
not leaping; the skin is shagreened, and the separation of
the rings usually marked by a smooth shining band. On the belly,
at a small distance from the edge, a set of circular spots may be
perceived, two on each ring, except the last; these are the spiracula.
Examined internally, we find one large artery, a stomach,
and intestines. The instant it perceives the light, it endeavours
to gain its obscure habitation, and seldom fails in making good its
retreat.</p>

<h4>OF THE PEDICULUS HUMANUS, OR LOUSE.</h4>

<p>&#8220;Whenever wretchedness, disease, and hunger seize upon
man, the louse seldom fails to add itself to the tribe, and to increase
in proportion to the number of his calamities.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the human louse is examined with the microscope, its
deformity fills us with disgust. In the head we may distinguish
two fine black eyes, looking backward and fenced with hair; near<span class="pagenum" id="Page620">[620]</span>
these are the two antenn&aelig;, each of which has five joints set with
short bristles; the fore-part of the head is rather long, the hinder
more round or obtuse; there is a small part that projects from the
nose or snout, this serves as a sheath or case to the proboscis or
piercer, which the creature thrusts into the skin to draw out the
blood and humours which are its destined food, for it has no
mouth which opens in the common way.</p>

<p>This proboscis has been estimated to be seven-hundred times
smaller than a hair; it is contained in another case within the
first, and can be drawn in or thrust out at pleasure; the skin is
hard and transparent. From the under side proceed six legs,
each of which has five joints, and terminates in two unequal
hooked claws, these it uses as we would a thumb and finger;
there are hairs between the claws, as well as all over the legs;
the body finishes in a cloven tail, which is generally covered, and
partly concealed by hairs.</p>

<p>From the extreme transparency of its skin, the internal parts
may be seen to greater advantage than in any other insect; as,
the various ramifications of the veins and arteries, in which a
kind of regular pulsation may be observed, as well as the peristaltic
motion of the intestines, which is continued from the stomach
to the tail. When the louse feeds, the blood rushes like a
torrent into the stomach, moving with so strong a propulsion and
contraction, as appears very curious. The digestive powers are
so great, that the colour of the blood changes in its passage from
thick and black at its first entrance, to a fine ruby colour in the
intestines, and nearly white in the veins. Its greediness is so
great, that the excrement contained in the intestines is ejected at
the same time, to make room for this new supply. There is
scarce any animal that multiplies so fast as this unwelcome intruder;
the moment it is excluded from the egg it begins to breed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page621">[621]</span></p>

<p>It would be endless to describe the various creatures which go
under the name of lice, and swarm upon every part of nature.
The reader, desirous of a more particular account of those which
infest various animals, will obtain full satisfaction, by consulting
Rhedi&#8217;s Treatise de Generatione Insectorum.</p>

<h4>OF THE ARANEA, OR SPIDER.</h4>

<p>The spider is another insect which is often examined with the
microscope, and certainly affords much matter for observation.
&#8220;Formed for a life of rapacity, and incapable of living but by
blood, all its habits are calculated to deceive and surprize; it
spreads toils to entangle its prey; it is endued with patience to
expect its coming, and is possessed of arms and strength to destroy
it when fallen into the snare.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--poem-->

</div><!--poemcenter-->

<p>The eyes of the spider have been described in <a href="#Page199">page 199</a>, they
are a very beautiful microscopic object, viewed either as transparent<span class="pagenum" id="Page622">[622]</span>
or opake. The spider has eight legs with three joints,
thickly beset with hairs, and terminating in three crooked moveable
claws, which have little teeth like a saw; at a small distance
from these claws, but placed higher up, is another something
like a cock&#8217;s spur, by the assistance of which it adheres to
its webs; but the weapon wherewith it seizes and kills its prey
is a pair of sharp crooked claws or forceps placed in the fore-part
of the head. The insect can open or extend these pincers as
occasion may require; when undisturbed, it suffers them to lie
one upon another, concealed in two cases constructed for their
reception. Leeuwenhoeck says, that each of these claws has a
small aperture or slit, through which he supposes a poisonous
juice is injected into the wound it makes.</p>

<p>The exuvia, or cast-off skin of the spider, which may be found
in cobwebs, being transparent, is an excellent object; and the
fangs or forceps may be more easily separated from it, and examined
with greater exactness than in a living subject. The contexture
of the spider&#8217;s web, and the manner of weaving it, have
been discovered by the microscope. The spider is supplied with
a large quantity of glutinous matter within its body, and five
tubercles or nipples for spinning it into thread, of what size it
pleases, either by opening or contracting the sphincter muscles.
This substance, when examined accurately, will be found twisted
into many coils, of an agate colour, and which from its tenacity
may be easily drawn out into threads. The five nipples are
placed near the extremity of the tail; from these the aforesaid
substance proceeds; it adheres to any thing against which it is
pressed, and being drawn out hardens in the air. The threads
unite at a small distance from the body, so that those which
appear to us so fine and single, are, notwithstanding, composed
of five joined together, and these are many times doubled when
the web is in formation. The web serves him for the double<span class="pagenum" id="Page623">[623]</span>
purpose of an habitation and of a machine for catching his food;
for in the center of this web it dwells in dismal solitude, like a
dragon in his lonely den, an image of the evil one, wasting all
things round about it, and eager to destroy every appearance of
life. When first hatched, even these loathsome insects seem endued
with a principle of association, spinning a web in common;
but this connection is of short duration, and soon terminates by
their destroying one another. If, like the silk-worm, they were
disposed to live together peaceably, it is possible that their labours
might be productive of advantages nearly similar to that
valuable insect; for which purpose repeated attempts have been
made, though they proved ineffectual.</p>

<h4>OF THE CULEX, OR GNAT.</h4>

<p>The gnat is a beautiful object for the microscope. The curious
manner in which it disposes its eggs upon the surface of the
water has been noticed in <a href="#Page288">page 288</a>. From the egg proceeds the
larva, in which state it is most happily suited to shew the several
operations of life; for a moderate magnifying power will discover
what passes within its transparent body. It has a large scaly
head, with two large antenn&aelig;, besides several hairy parts, and
articulated bristles near the mouth, which are in continual motion.
If the worm be dissected, the feet of the gnat may be
found folded up in the divisions of the thorax; the abdomen is
divided into eight rings, from the edges of each of which three or
four bristles proceed. The tail is divided into two parts of very
different forms; by one of these it can steer itself in any direction;
in the other, two pulmonary tubes may be discovered,
through which the insect breathes. The larva has a power of
moistening the tail with an oleaginous liquor, by which means it
can suspend itself on the surface of the water. On agitating the
water, the worms descend with precipitation to the bottom; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page624">[624]</span>
they soon return to the surface, to breathe the air through the
tube that is annexed to their tail. From this state, they pass into
that of the pupa, which is the gnat enclosed in a third skin, under
which it is formed and strengthened; the organs of respiration
are changed, breathing at this period through a couple of horns,
which are placed near the head, keeping itself rolled upon the
surface of the water, though on the least motion it unrolls itself
and descends, aided by the oars near the tail.</p>

<p>From the spoils of the pupa, a little winged insect proceeds,
whose every part is active to the highest degree, and whose
entire structure is the just object of our admiration. Its head,
adorned with feathers, is a fine microscopic object; but the proboscis
may be deemed one of the most curious instruments in the
insect creation. This formidable apparatus has been particularly
described in <a href="#Page187">page 187</a>.</p>

<p>The exuvi&aelig; or cast-off skins of insects, being exceedingly
transparent, are well adapted for observation, as they exhibit the
external appearance of the little animal; among these, may be
reckoned those of spiders and cimices, but particularly the forficula
auricularia or earwig, which is an elegant exuvia; a magnified
view of the beautiful wing of this insect is exhibited in
<a href="#Plate14">Plate XIV.</a> and described in <a href="#Page205">page 205</a>. The stings of insects
vary not only in their form, but also in their apparatus; most of
them require dissection; as the stings, for they have generally
two, are inclosed in a hard sheath or case, to which is added a
pair of feelers. The stings of bees, wasps, &amp;c. are barbed, while
those of the chrysis are serrated, or notched like a saw. The head
of insects is furnished with an instrument or proboscis various as
the insects themselves, but all meriting attention, as being admirably
adapted to their different uses and purposes. Among the
most remarkable are those of the bed bug, flea, gnat, empis,<span class="pagenum" id="Page625">[625]</span>
conops, &amp;c. to which may be added the singular one of the tabanus,
described in <a href="#Page188">page 188</a>, and figured in <a href="#Plate16">Plate XVI.</a> A description
of the apparatus of the bee has also been given in
<a href="#Page181">page 181</a>, and of that of the butterfly in <a href="#Page186">page 186</a>.</p>

<p>The antenn&aelig; of moths, butterflies, and most other insects, display
as great beauty in their formation as they are endless in
their variety; the distinguishing characters of many of them have
been described in <a href="#Page190">pages 190</a>-<a href="#Page193">193</a>, and that of the lepas anatifera
in particular in <a href="#Page345">page 345</a>, and exhibited in <a href="#Plate13">Plate XIII.</a></p>

<p>The eyes of insects are singularly constructed, but this structure
is not discoverable without the assistance of the microscope;
the eyes of the libellula are hexagonal, see <a href="#Plate16">Plate XVI.</a> Fig. 3, and
their description in <a href="#Page195">page 195</a>; those of the lobster are square, as
exhibited in Fig. 5 of the same plate, and described in <a href="#Page197">page 197</a>.</p>

<p>The hair of animals, as the mouse, goat, large bee, and many
species of caterpillars, particularly the tufts on the head and tail
of the larva of the phal&aelig;na antiqua, offer many beauties to the
curious observer. The bristles of a hog, cut transversely, appear
tubular, and the root of hair is evidently bulbous.</p>

<p>The muscular fibres, and every anatomical preparation that can
be brought under the microscope, are pleasing objects; the reader
will meet with many curious and interesting observations on the
hairs, the muscles, nerves, and other parts of the human body, in
Fontana&#8217;s Treatise on the Venom of Vipers.</p>

<p>The legs of all insects appear very much diversified, and their
mechanism truly astonishing, according with their different occupations,
as particularized in <a href="#Page210">pages 210</a>-<a href="#Page212">212</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page626">[626]</span></p>

<p>Scales of fish, as soles, roach, dace, salmon, eels, &amp;c. as also
the scales of snakes, lizards, &amp;c. &amp;c. Specimens of scales are
given in <a href="#Plate10">Plates X.</a> and <a href="#Plate19">XIX</a>. The scales form a light, but at the
same time a solid and smooth covering to the fish; they hinder
the fluid from penetrating the body, for which purpose they are
laid in a kind of natural oil; they serve also as a protection, and
break the force of any accidental blow, which may be the reason
why river-fish have larger and stronger scales than sea-fish, being
more liable to accidents.</p>

<p>The purple tide of life, nay the very globules of the blood, may
be seen distinctly rolling through veins and arteries smaller than
the finest hair.<a href="#Footnote151" id="FNanchor151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote151"><a href="#FNanchor151" class="label">[151]</a> The
manner of viewing the particles of the blood has been described in <a href="#Page149">p. 149</a>, together
with some remarks on their form, by our author. It was not my intention to have renewed
the subject; but a chirurgical treatise having been lately published by Everard Home, Esq.
F. R. S. in which it appears that he has paid particular attention towards investigating these
minute particles, and ascertaining their true form, I shall here subjoin an abstract.</p>

<p>&#8220;As the result of microscopical experiments has been found exceedingly fallacious, a prejudice
has very naturally arisen against all experiments of this kind upon the secretions of the
human body, from a supposition that they are not to be depended upon. But it is right that
we should discriminate, and not condemn the use of the microscope altogether, because from
ignorance of its principles it has been misapplied; since these very deceptions have been the
means of our acquiring a more accurate knowledge of the use and application of that instrument.</p>

<p>&#8220;The errors in the use of the microscope have arisen from increasing the magnifying powers
of the glasses too much, and not taking in all the circumstances relating to the refraction of the
rays of light, making no allowance for the aberration. An attention to the aberration alone
will explain the different appearances under which the red globules of the blood have been represented.
Some have found them perfect spheres, which will always be the case when the glasses
are perfectly adjusted, and the object placed at the true focal distance. Others have found them
annular, from the object being at the focal distance of the rays transmitted near the circumference
of the magnifying glass, which are refracted in a greater degree, and consequently shorter
than the central rays. Others, again, have viewed them as flattened bodies of a circular figure,
bright in the center, and becoming darker towards the edges; which appearance arises from the
object being at the focal distance of the central rays of the magnifying glass, which will be less
refracted than those near the circumference. Although such are the errors which arise, when
microscopical researches are pushed beyond certain bounds; yet, that the red part of the blood is
made up of globules, is a discovery for which we are indebted to the microscope, and which
seems to be as well ascertained as any discovery in anatomy or physiology. The appearances of
pus are equally distinct, when examined on the field of a microscope, as the globules of the
blood; they are visible with a small degree of magnifying power, and are the same to the eyes of
different persons.&#8221; <span class="smcap">Edit.</span></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Feathers, and parts of feathers of birds, are not to be passed by
or unnoticed; but it is impossible to point out any of these in
preference to others, as each has its peculiar beauties; the plumul&aelig;
of these have generally in the microscope the appearance of
large feathers; the pith contained in the quill, if cut transversely
and examined, exhibits an admirable reticular texture. Many<span class="pagenum" id="Page627">[627]</span>
other parts of birds will afford a great variety of curious objects,
particularly the egg: Mr. Martin says, that the internal spongy
substance of bones may be better observed in those of birds, than
of any other animal; even the feathers or scales of a moth&#8217;s wing
amply repay the observer; these also vary in their texture and
figure; but the largest and most commonly applied, are from the
body of the sphinx stellatarum, or humming-bird moth; a specimen
is given in <a href="#Plate16">Plate XVI.</a> Fig. E F H I.</p>

<p>Transverse sections of all kinds of wood, especially those of a
pithy or soft nature, form some of the most delightful objects for
the microscope; among these, the section of fern root will be
found strikingly curious, from the singular disposition of the air
and sap vessels; their beauty will be seen by the figures in <a href="#Plate28">Plates
XXVIII.</a> <a href="#Plate29">XXIX.</a> and <a href="#Plate30">XXX.</a></p>

<p>Flowers, whose brilliancy and variety constitute one of the
principal beauties of nature, each being distinguished from the
rest by some peculiar beauty or shining character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page628">[628]</span></p>

<p>The flowers of most grasses, with all the varieties of mosses;
the farina of flowers; mouldiness, which evidently appears to vegetate;
all the kinds of sponge; sea-weeds; particularly the conferv&aelig;,
which are jointed like a cane. The extensive family of
corallines present an elegant appearance; the most beautiful are
the sea hair, sea fir, sickle, fox tail, &amp;c. described by Ellis.</p>

<p>Dissected leaves, which shew the fibres and nerves; the human
intestine injected with wax is a fine object; as are many other
anatomical preparations. The seed of the silver-rind birch appears
like an insect; seed of the quaking grass is also much admired,
as is the leaf which covers the seed of sorrel. Among
artificial productions, the edge of a razor, and point of a fine
needle, as also fine cambrick, evidently discover the inferiority of
the workman; particles from the collision of flint and steel; wire
melted by the electric explosion, and other articles innumerable.</p>

<p>Besides these, there is an immense variety of objects which can
only be satisfactorily examined alive, such as polypes, minute
aquatic insects; animalcula of various infusions, as eels in paste,
vinegar, &amp;c. The eyes and teeth of snails; the circulation of the
blood in the tails of fishes, &amp;c.<a href="#Footnote152" id="FNanchor152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

from time to time afforded delight to the attentive and diligent
microscopic observer, little doubt can be entertained but that
amidst the immense variety of minute shells, as well as the seeds
of vegetables, numbers remain unexplored, though highly meriting
notice.</p>

<p>With the hope of exciting the attention of the curious toward
these subjects, and affording hints to those who may happily
possess inclination, together with leisure and opportunity to pursue
the inquiry, I shall enumerate to the reader a few specimens
of each of these admirable productions of nature; towards
the elucidating of which, very little, comparatively, has as yet
been done.</p>

<p>As far as my knowledge extends, the first author who has
treated on the subject of minute and rare shells, is Plancus, who
published a treatise in quarto, at Venice, in the year 1739, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page630">[630]</span>
the title &#8220;De Conchis Ariminensibus minus notis;&#8221; a third and
improved edition of which appeared in 1760. It is a very curious
and learned work, containing a natural history of testaceous animals
of Rimini, an Italian town situated on the Adriatic shore;
and more particularly of minute nautili.</p>

<p>In the year 1784, Mr. Walker of Faversham published in quarto
a collection of minute shells, which was the joint production of
himself and William Boys, Esq. F. S. A. of Sandwich, in Kent,
assisted by the late Edward Jacob, Esq. F. S. A. It contains an
arrangement and concise description of ninety shells, accompanied
with neatly engraved figures of the whole series; the greater part
of them as well in their magnified state, as that in which they
appear to the naked eye. Specimens of those which are esteemed
most curious and rare, I have selected from this work: a reference
to the original will afford the reader more complete satisfaction,
and possibly animate him to further pursuits.</p>

<p>This publication appeared in so favourable a light to that eminent
patron of science, Sir Joseph Banks, that I should accuse
myself of unjustifiable remissness, were I to neglect this opportunity
of introducing an extract from the copy of a letter addressed
by him to the late Mr. Jacob, which is now in my possession.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8221; (the Royal Society) &#8220;are all much obliged to you for
the pains you have taken in bringing this work to light. Natural
history is, I am convinced, more benefited by a thin volume of
real new facts, which is the case in yours, than by a folio of
comments generally written by those who mean to receive praise,
more founded on the elegance with which they express the ideas
they conceive, than on any prospect of utility to be derived from
the ideas themselves. From such naturalists, De Buffon, &amp;c.
good Lord deliver our honest science.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page631">[631]</span></p>

<p>That truly amiable, and no less intelligent lady, the late
Duchess Dowager of Portland, likewise expressed her approbation
of the work in a letter to Mr. Boys.</p>

<p>By this publication, a number of shells, heretofore unknown,
are added to the British conchology, sufficient to shew that the
path is now laid open and made easy of access to inquisitive naturalists
in different parts of the kingdom for still greater discoveries.
Indeed, it is rather extraordinary, that the authors of
this country, who have so advantageously applied the microscope
to a variety of objects in the animal kingdom, should have neglected
to examine the shores of our own seas, crowded as they
are with objects equally worthy of their investigation. Baker&#8217;s
observation in his &#8220;Employment for the Microscope,&#8221; p. 244, is
entitled to more attention than has been paid to it. &#8220;Shell-fish,&#8221;
says he, &#8220;are objects that have as yet been very slightly
examined by the microscope, and therefore the serious inquirer
into nature&#8217;s secret operations may here be certain of discovering
beauties, which at present he can have no conception of.&#8221; But
thus it is, nature opens her rich and inexhaustible treasures by
slow degrees to the inquisitive mind of man. In fact, different
observers have generally different pursuits, otherwise these objects
would scarcely have escaped the attention of many ingenious naturalists,
particularly the quick-sighted Mr. Ellis, who has so
clearly investigated and described the corals and corallines of the
adjacent coasts.</p>

<p>To those who have perused the treatise of Plancus, already
mentioned, it is necessary to observe, that though the sand on
our coasts contain a vast variety of specimens, yet it by no means
appears so productive as the sand of Rimini; lest, despairing of
success in their first researches, they may be induced to desist<span class="pagenum" id="Page632">[632]</span>
from further examination. Every parcel will, however, be found
to contain some of the more common shells.</p>

<p>It may not be improper here to point out to future inquirers
the mode of facilitating the discovery of these minute objects.
The sand being perfectly dried, put a handful on an open sheet
of paper, and by gently shaking it from side to side, the minute
shells, being specifically lighter than the sand, will be separated
from, and lie on its surface, and will thus be more expeditiously
procured than by any other method. It is also adviseable to
place the objects intended for inspection in a situation secured
from any sudden blast of air, otherwise, owing to their levity,
they may be unexpectedly blown away, and a loss sustained of
some of the rarer specimens; even incautiously breathing on
them, or coughing, may be productive of similar disagreeable
effects.</p>

<p>The following observations by an ingenious critic<a href="#Footnote153" id="FNanchor153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> are so apposite,
and so perfectly coincident with my own sentiments on the
subject, that I cannot resist the impulse I feel to enable the reader
to partake of the pleasure which I have experienced in their perusal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let not the minuteness of the objects here delineated call
up the surly inquiries of those, who have not been accustomed to
live with their eyes open to the works of nature: they are not fit
judges in these matters. If they will persist in asking, Of what
use is all this labour? What good can accrue to mankind from
this knowledge, in point of food, or other use? We know of none
at all, either present or likely to happen, as to the body, for use<span class="pagenum" id="Page633">[633]</span>
or ornament, or to the satisfying any appetite: nevertheless, a
much nobler idea will take its rise in our opinion; one which, by
displaying so momentously the power of the omniscient Creator,
will thwart the infidel in his favourite ideas of escaping the eyes
of the Almighty, and force him, as he descends the scale from the
more immense objects to these minutissima, to confess, that the
being which has formed these, can fully equal all that the tongue
of man has yet declared of the possibility of his power. For,
what a train of wonders have we here to pursue? What must be
the &#339;conomy of animals so very diminutive, so weak, so exposed
from their situation to the force of every rude wave, and who,
notwithstanding, so often escape unhurt? How do they rear their
young? From whence collect their prey?&#8221;</p>

Gromwell. This seed is in figure exactly like a human heart
without the auricles, but has no flat or depressed part on its sides;
it is pretty circular round its thickest part, and terminates in a
blunt cone. At the thickest extremity there is a circular roughness,
which is the umbilicus, and from thence to the cone on the
shortest side it is bisulcated longitudinally; so that the space
between the sulci is a kind of ridge, nor do either sulci or ridge
extend to either extremity of the seed; the rest of the surface is
smooth and polished, the ground a light ash-colour, with a shade
or cloud of yellow or brown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page646">[646]</span></p>

<p>These seeds are very hard, and the ash-coloured shell is brittle
like that of a hen&#8217;s egg; which being broken, appears to be lined
with a light olive-coloured uniform membrane, which encloses a
nucleus of a Spanish snuff-colour, pretty smooth, and of the same
form with its shell, being in close contact with it all round.</p>

<p>The natural size of a middling grain of this seed is about the
eighth part of an inch long, and the ninth of an inch in diameter
at the roundest part.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><span class="smcap">Cyminum.</span></h4>

<p class="hinline">Fig. 2. Cuminum C. Linn. Cummin. This seed
is double, though fixed side by side to one little stem; both which
while together seem like one, and are ribbed in an uneven manner
longitudinally, having great numbers of little threads or fibres
sticking out all over them, which makes them look hoary. They
are thick in the middle and run to a cone at each end. At the
upper extremity there is an appearance like a bifurcation in the
stilus, each of them belonging to its particular seed; this appears
when the seeds are separated.</p>

<p>These seeds are of a darkish straw-colour, the little threads or
fibres being much lighter than the body of the seed. Each of
these seeds contains in it a kernel of an olive-colour, and exactly
in shape like a waterman&#8217;s boat, and of the same proportion,
having a concave and convex side; the latter has a blunt ridge
like the keel of a boat, and the former has a white line from one
end to the other, which proves to be a ridge, to which the stilus
that rises from the little stem of the seed, adheres to support it.</p>

<p>When the seeds are together upon the stem their length is about
the fifth part of an inch, and about an eighth part of an inch in
the broadest part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page647">[647]</span></p>

<h4 class="inline"><span class="smcap">Papaver Album.</span></h4>

<p class="hinline">Fig. 3. P. somniferum. Linn. Poppy.
This is a little yellowish white seed exactly resembling in shape
a sheep&#8217;s kidney, having a yellow place about the hollow part,
which is its umbilicus, analogous to the hollow part of the kidney
into which the blood-vessels (emulgents) enter.</p>

<p>If it be viewed on the back or convex part, concealing the
hollow, it is exactly shaped like an egg, having one end somewhat
rounder than the other.</p>

<p>All over its surface it has superficial cells, formed by ridges
that rise from the surface, which are some heptagons, some pentagons,
but for the most part hexagons, though not precisely of
equal sides; and the bottoms of these cells seem to be very porous.</p>

<p>The seeds seem very light and springy, as a gentle blast of
ones breath is capable of blowing them away, or a touch of any
thing of making them roll a considerable way. As to their size,
they are not above a twenty-fourth part of an inch long, and
about a thirtieth part broad or thick.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><span class="smcap">Carduus Benedictus.</span></h4>

<p class="hinline">Fig. 4. Centaurea Benedicta. Linn.
Blessed Thistle. The body of this seed is about twice as long as
it is thick, is round and shaped much like a nine-pin, only instead
of being small at the upper end, it has a stricture, from whence
arises a beautiful crown of ten angles or points, out of which
come also ten arist&aelig; or spicul&aelig; like ivory, about the length of the
body of the seed, running taper upward, and set round in an uniform
manner. Within the circle of these long spikes there are
ten more, which are but very short, and of the same colour and
consistence with the others. When these are all plucked off, the
vestiges of the circles they form appear in the upper surface of<span class="pagenum" id="Page648">[648]</span>
the crown; in the middle of which a little process arises, but
very superficially. That part which appears circular is white,
and the rest of this surface, of the corona, of the same colour
with the rest of the body of the seed, which is a sort of an olive-colour.</p>

<p>The body of the seed is of the sulcated kind, and looks exactly
like a fluted pillar, and the surface shines as if varnished with
some gummy substance.</p>

<p>At the lower or small end of this seed, there is an opening
reaching up above a third of the length of the body of the seed,
which discovers a white root, shaped like a cone at the bottom,
and rising thicker by degrees till it divides into three limbs; these
run taper upwards, till they are lost in the parenchyma of the
seed, which at the place of their entrance appears somewhat fungous,
but is more compact and clammy through its substance.</p>

<p>The length of the body is more than two eighths of an inch,
and the arist&aelig; exactly the same length. The corona is its umbilicus.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><span class="smcap">Plantago.</span></h4>

<p class="hinline">Fig. 5. P. Major. Linn. Plantain. By the imperfect
idea we have of this seed from its minuteness, it may
seem like a flea, as any small speck would, if a little oblong;
yet its form is not constant, that is, there are scarce two of them
precisely alike, some being perfectly elliptical, some with blunt
angles, and some approaching a spheroid. They have a whitish
mark on one side, which is the umbilicus of the seed, from
whence the first rudiments of the plant spring, and the surface is
entirely granulated over, and has a general appearance like some
kinds of plumb-stones; the surface also shines a little, as if oiled
or moist, and their colour is brown. One of the seeds cut transversely<span class="pagenum" id="Page649">[649]</span>
appears to have the shell or covering pretty strong in
proportion to its size, which contains a parenchyma that is very
porous and succulent. It is about a sixteenth part of an inch
long, and a twenty-second broad.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><span class="smcap">Staphis Agria.</span></h4>

<p class="hinline">Fig. 6 and 7. Delphinum S. A. Linn. Stavesacre.
The seeds of this plant are rough and angular, inclining to
a triangle, although imperfectly so. They may be considered as
having a basis or apex; the basis is thick and clumsy, and the
apex runs to an angular point, which point is the umbilicus of
the seed, out of which its first rudiments arise; it also has a convex
and a plane or concave side; the former, Fig. 7, is rough, by
reason of its being covered all over with porous cells, the ridges
of which are also depressed or indented with rough pores, and
granulated as if stuck full of sand. The concave surface, Fig. 6,
is also rough, but not in the same manner, and so are the sides,
which have a little flatness; these also are porous and sandy, and
before the microscope, shine, and are coloured like dirty brown
sugar-candy. The concave surface, notwithstanding the roughness,
has one longitudinal ridge, and sometimes more, running
from the basis to the apex, which has the same granulated surface
with the rest. It contains a parenchyma, which is of a yellowish
grey colour, and is moist and succulent.</p>

<p>This seed is in its natural size about two eighths of an inch
long from its basis to the apex, and near as broad; however, some
are broader in proportion to their length than others, and they are
one eighth of an inch thick.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><span class="smcap">Anisum.</span></h4>

<p class="hinline">Fig. 8 and 9. Pimpinella A. Linn. Anise. Two
of these seeds grow together upon one little stalk; when they
are pulled asunder, they appear to have a flat and a convex surface.
On the convex surface, Fig. 8, each seed has three ribs<span class="pagenum" id="Page650">[650]</span>
placed at equal distances from one another, which are porous and
a little rough, being of a straw-colour; and the spaces between
them are also rough and porous, but of an olive-colour. The
flat surface, Fig. 9, has a white ridge running longitudinally from
its basis to the apex in the middle; this white ridge or line serves
to cling to the stilus, upon which it sticks. The stilus is also
white, and has the same contexture with the ridge, and is bifid,
in order to support two seeds with their flat sides together,
which keeps them the more compact and less liable to injuries
than if a single seed stuck on. It is certain, a single stilus would
do as well to support two seeds as the bifid one, for even the two
stick together as if single, if there was not a necessity for a double
stilus, for a very important reason; which is, that when the
seeds are ripe, they would stick on a single one, till the time of
their being scattered about would pass, which would be a detriment
to their propagation; but the stilus being double, and of a
springy nature, the two parts are glued together, as long as moisture
remains about the seeds capable of keeping them together;
but when the seeds are grown ripe and dry, then this moisture is
exhaled, and the stilus, as well as the flat surfaces of the seeds,
begin to contract from their former plumpness; the stilus first
begins to split asunder, and thereby separates the two surfaces of
the seeds, each of which sticks loosely to its particular limb of
the stilus; till at length the remaining moisture exhaling more
and more, it grows rigid, and cracks with a blast of wind, and so
the seed is scattered or sown in the ground in its due time.
This is a most excellent provision of nature, and highly worth
regard.</p>

<p>When the two seeds are sticking together, they have a round
end which is the basis, and grow smaller by degrees upward, till
they become an apex, having upon each seed a kind of fungous or
bulbous corona, which is the umbilicus of the seed; and the shape<span class="pagenum" id="Page651">[651]</span>
of the two together may be compared to that of a given fig reversed.
The parenchyma of these seeds is that of a pale greenish
olive-colour. They are more exactly of a size than most other
seeds, and are each one-eighth part of an inch long, and more
than half that breadth.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><span class="smcap">F&#339;niculum Dulce.</span></h4>

<p class="hinline">Fig. 10 and 11. Anethum F. Linn.
Sweet Fennel. In viewing these seeds, they do not look much
unlike one species of the cucumber in general, some of them
being thicker and longer than others, and some straighter; but
upon applying the microscope, the ridges appear high, and form
deep furrows.</p>

<p>Two of these seeds grow together upon the same little stalk,
which is divided, like that of the anise seed, into a double or bifid
stilus, in the same manner, and for the same reasons; when the
two are pulled asunder, they appear to have a flat surface, Fig. 10,
and a round and ridged one, Fig. 11. On the former, these characters
are conspicuous: viz. 1. The whitish cortex or covering
of the seed shews its edge distinctly. 2. Withinside this edge a
white fungous substance appears running parallel to, and in close
contact with it, on each side from end to end, being both together
about one-third of the breadth of the seed; and between
these, in the center, there appears a dark brown elliptical substance,
which, upon separating the cortical and fungous coverings,
appears to be a nucleus, whose internal substance is of an
olive colour and something succulent. On the external surface
there appears three high ridges, and when the flat faces of the
seeds are close together upon the stilus, so as to seem but one,
these three ridges on each seed and the two edges of each meeting
firmly together, form eight regular ridges equally divided
upon that round body that we have before said to resemble a
cucumber. The extremity which is fixed to the stem is smaller<span class="pagenum" id="Page652">[652]</span>
than the other; the latter has a fungous kind of process arising
from the body of the seed, which is the umbilicus of the seed.
The ridges are of a light straw-colour, and the bottoms of the
sulci they form are darkish. A middling seed is somewhat more
than two-eighths of an inch long, and above half that breadth.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><span class="smcap">Grana Paradisi.</span></h4>

<p class="hinline">Fig. 12 and 13. Amomum G. P. Linn.
Grains of Paradise. These seeds are of an irregular form, but
may be said to have a basis and apex; the basis is generally so
flat as to render it capable of standing well upon it; the sides
consist of several flats and angles, and the apex looks very much
like the mouth of a purse drawn or gathered up close together.</p>

<p>The body of the seed is of a reddish brown colour, the surface
much granulated and rough; and the apex, which is its umbilicus,
degenerates from this reddish brown colour into a yellow, appearing
in little oblong ridges or plates.</p>

<p>Upon making a transverse section of this seed, a most beautiful
appearance presents itself; the external cortex is very thin,
and retains the same colour through its substance with the outer
surface; this incloses a black, porous, pitchy substance, which is
much thicker than the cortex, in close contact with it, and at the
angles of the seed is pretty considerable. Next to this the parenchyma
appears, as white as the finest white salt, and radiated
from the center outward; and in this transverse section seems to
have a round hole in the center of one of the divided parts, and
a process answerable to it in the other. If a longitudinal incision
be made through the middle, the appearance will be as in Fig. 13,
when the center of the white parenchyma appears exactly like a
modern vinegar glass, commonly called a cruet, the bottom of
which tends obliquely towards the basis, and the top towards the
apex of the seed. The surface of this part looks polished, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page653">[653]</span>
the colour is a yellowish olive; nor does it look unlike a gummy
or resinous body; however, we cannot be certain what its substance
is, notwithstanding its great resemblance to that kind of
matter. The white parenchyma is very singular, being almost
divided into two lobes by this little cruet, whose top runs up into
or is lost in a remarkable circular part, which has a rising towards
the umbilicus of the seed in form of an acorn, and this rising
stands in the open place, into which the pursy umbilicus leads.
As to its natural dimensions, an ordinary seed is somewhat more
than the eighth of an inch long, and about an eighth thick.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><span class="smcap">Petroselinum.</span></h4>

<p class="hinline">Fig. 14. Apium P. Linn. Common Parsley.
The seeds of this garden parsley, being of the umbellated kind,
grow two upon a little stem, whose bifid stilus supports them like
the ammi or smallage; they are striated or ribbed like those, having
three of such ribs on the convex part, spread further asunder,
and being much more conspicuous than those of either of the
seeds just mentioned. There is another rib which runs on each
side of the seed, which is its lateral rib, and that which runs
round the edge of the flat surface makes it resemble the edge or
gunnel of a barge or lighter, to which each of these bears some
resemblance. This seed is considerably larger than either, and
much longer in proportion to their size; the colour of the interstices
between the ribs is a dusky olive, and the ribs of an oaker
yellow. They are pretty round where they rest on the stem,
and run up elliptically to an apex, where there is a fungous corona,
which is the umbilicus. In making a transverse section
through the middle of one of them, the parenchyma appears of
the same form with the cortex, having this remarkable property,
that between the ridges or ribs are canals, formed of the cortex
and the surface of the parenchyma, containing a brown
balsamic fluid, with which they are filled from one end to the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page654">[654]</span>
of the seed; and in some seeds this balsam appears all round between
the parenchyma and the cortex. This will be further explained
when we come to speak of the seseli, in which this is
so apparent, that a transverse view of that seed will serve for
both. The parenchyma is somewhat succulent, and of a greyish
olive colour. An ordinary seed is one-eighth of an inch long,
and about a sixteenth thick.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><span class="smcap">Petroselinum Macedonicum.</span></h4>

<p class="hinline">Fig. 15 and 16. Bubon Macedonicum.
Linn. Macedonian Parsley. These are long slender
elliptical seeds, growing like the seeds of other umbelliferous
plants, two together on the stem and bifid stilus; when they are
pulled asunder they appear each to have a convex or back side,
and a flat part or belly. The convex side, Fig. 15, may be said,
from its roundness at one end, and smallness at the other, to have
a basis and apex; the former is round, and after swelling a little
towards the middle, runs taper upwards, till within one-fifth of
its length there arise two rough hairy processes, one on each side,
like ears, and the rest runs to a point; so that the entire back
surface is a near representation of a mouse lying flat. The colour
of the body of this seed is a kind of olive, but the hoary
fibres all over are of an ash-colour, and the stri&aelig; or ridges much
the same.</p>

<p>The flat surface, Fig. 16, is of a brown colour and porous,
having none of these fibres upon it; and is surrounded by an
edge or ridge, like those on the back of the seed, which are also
hoary. Upon this surface the bifid stilus is apparent, one extremity
of which terminates at a hollow part, that may be likened
to the under jaw of the mouse, between the roots of the ears;
and the other stands loose, to which the fellow-seed was also
attached.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page655">[655]</span></p>

<p>The ridges are also hollow, like those of the garden parsley,
and contain such a balsamic fluid as that; but this being so exceedingly
slender, requires the greatest magnifier of the microscope
for opake objects to discern it. This seed is about an eighth
of an inch long, and about a twentieth broad.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><span class="smcap">Coriandrum.</span></h4>

<p class="hinline">Fig. 17, 18, and 19. C. sativum. Linn. Coriander.
The seed of common coriander is spherical when entire,
and may be said to have two poles; the lower, or that into which
the stem is fixed, which forms a fungous hole, and the upper or
little apex, as at Fig. 17, this is the umbilicus of the seed. From
one of these poles to the other several ridges or stri&aelig; run like the
lines of longitude upon the globe, between which there are several
roughnesses; they are of a yellowish oaker colour, and about
the sixth of an inch in diameter, or something less.</p>

<p>Each of these seeds, upon being bruised, divides into two hemispheres,
Fig. 18, which discovers the edges of the rigid cortex,
on the concave side there is a rising, and within it a lens, concave
on one side and convex on the other, Fig. 19, as it is turned out
of the cortex. On the concave side is a rising in the middle extending
from one pole to the other, and on each side just below
the apex, there is a white roundish fungous spot rising from the
surface, from each of which runs downward a little curved a
ridge, which appears to be resinous; and the surface is rough, and
has a great many particles of resin also.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><span class="smcap">Seseli.</span></h4>

<p class="hinline">Fig. 20 to 24. S. Montanum. Linn. Long-leaved
Meadow-saxifrage. This seed stripped of its foliaceous wings may
be compared to a sort of canoo which is too narrow in proportion
to its great length, has a hollow and a convex side, like that kind
of boat, and is ridged longitudinally on its convex side, Fig. 20,
from end to end, with four principal ridges; and between these,<span class="pagenum" id="Page656">[656]</span>
with others less considerable. There are, however, some of
these seeds wider than others in proportion, but the majority are
too long for their breadth, as I have said before.</p>

<p>These principal ridges are the support of the wings, and may
be called their basis, for they rise broad from the body of the
seed, and run out to a thin edge, which being continued constitute
this leafy border. These are yellowish, and the spaces between
them and the other less considerable ridges inclining to a
brown.</p>

<p>On the concave side, Fig. 21, there is an edge or gunnel like
that of a boat, and a considerable cavity from the edge; in the
center of which the vestige of the stilus, Fig. 22, which is also
bifid here, appears from one end to the other. The edge and
this vestige are also of a yellowish colour, but the rest of the
surface brown and porous, and the whole body of the seed and
ridges shine, as if varnished over with some oily substance.</p>

<p>Fig. 23 is a view of the convex side of a seed divested of its
wings, which is one of the most proportioned seeds I could
pick out; at the upper extremity of which a little process may
be perceived to turn or crook back upon the body; the same
may also be discerned on that of Fig. 20. At the root of this
process the opening or umbilicus of the seed lies.</p>

<p>Among the many beauties with which this seed abounds,
there is one that is most agreeably surprising, which (says our
author) I discovered by making a transverse section of one
of them, in order to see what its internal substance consisted
of. I no sooner applied the cut surface, Fig. 24, to my microscope,
than each of the principal ridges, which I said above is the
basis of the leafy wing, appeared to be a triangular tube, containing<span class="pagenum" id="Page657">[657]</span>
a fine brown liquid balsam of the colour of brown basilicon.
This was a high entertainment, as every other curious discovery
that arises by the diligent inspection of the seed is, and
prompted my examining others in the same manner; and I found
such a balsam as this common to the several kinds of parsley
seeds also, as well as to that of the bishop&#8217;s weed and smallage;
although these are so minute, that I could not be sensible of it
but with difficulty, and with one of my greatest magnifiers.
There is also something analogous to this in the sweet fennel and
finoki, not in tubes of the husks or cortex, but rather in spungy
channels that sink into the surface of the parenchyma, between
the ridges of these last. The length of an ordinary seed is one-third
of an inch, the thickness about an eighth, and the breadth
of each wing nearly equal to the thickness of the body.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><span class="smcap">Hyoscyamus.</span></h4>

<p class="hinline">Fig. 25. H. Niger. Linn. Common Henbane.
After the calyx has split and cracked by drying, the seed-pot
comes to be exposed to the heat of the sun, which also grows dry,
by which the lid or cover becomes loose, having no other visible
attachment to keep it on the edge of the pot but its moisture,
which in some measure helps to keep it there by agglutination,
as well as by the squeezing or pressure of the segments of the
calyx. But, this moisture exhaling, and the calyx splitting off,
the lid, being now dry, blows off with the first blast of wind,
and scatters the seeds, which by this time are hard and ripe.</p>

<p>When the seeds are ripe they are of a light colour, like white-brown
paper, and incline to a triangular figure, whose angles are
rounded off. They are depressed on both sides, so as to become
pretty flat, and their whole surface is cellular; the cells have no
particular form, but are somewhat irregular, and the ridges that
form them are pretty eminent. As the drawing appears, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page658">[658]</span>
seeds may be said to have a basis and an apex; the former has
no other particular mark than the cells, but the latter has a kind
of notch indented downward from the top, which is the umbilicus
of the seed. The parenchyma appears of a greyish colour.
A middling grain is about a sixteenth of an inch long, and not
quite so broad in the broadest part.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><span class="smcap">Cicer Rubrum.</span></h4>

<p class="hinline">Fig. 26 to 29. C. Arietinum. Linn. Chickpea.
There is a good deal of reason for comparing the chiche
grain to the head of a ram; for each of them, Fig. 26, consists of
a round or back part, and an apex or snout. There are, besides
this shape, which indeed favours the simile, several depressions
upon the grain which add still to the likeness of that head; and
these we shall consider in particular. On the upper or convex
side there is, in most of them, a longitudinal little ridge, and a
depression on each side, which resembles the rising in the frontal
bone of a sheep; and, a little further forward, two risings, one
on each side, which look like the superciliary eminences of the
eyes. Each side of the round or occipital part has a depression
that also adds to the same image; but what is yet a greater argument
for it, is, that the under part, Fig. 27, is flattish, having
an edge on each side, which may be compared to the edges of the
under jaw. In the center of this flat part there is a little mamillary
rising very remarkable, and just under the apex or snout an
oval hole, whitish at the bottom, which is the umbilicus of the
seed; besides which, there is an apparent sulcus on each side the
apex, running a little way back, and is a close resemblance to the
rictus oris. The husk is thin and fragile, and when taken off,
looks like thin tortoise-shell; and the nucleus or parenchyma is
of a yellowish white, exactly like the substance of a split-pea,
without the covering. The entire nucleus has the same depressions
which appear on its husk or cortex; and a fore view of it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page659">[659]</span>
Fig. 28, shews the naked apex, with the hole underneath, which
is but superficial; and the seam which distinguishes the tip of the
apex, I take to be the rudiment of the plant, for it is easily separated
in that seam. The natural size of this seed appears, Fig. 29,
being almost three-eighths of an inch from the apex to the outer
edge of the basis, and something narrower.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><span class="smcap">Laurus.</span></h4>

<p class="hinline">Fig. 30, 31, 32. L. nobilis. Linn. Bay-berries.
The bay-berries, Fig. 30, are a fruit of an oval shape, sticking to
a short stem not above a quarter of an inch long; the surface is
generally black, but some of them, whether through age I cannot
say, are crusted over with a dull ash-coloured scurfy matter,
and sometimes with fine ragged membranes. When the husk is
opened, it appears of a fine dark-brown colour on the inner surface,
being a smooth thin membrane that lines the husk, and at
the smaller end it suddenly grows yellowish, and looks like a
brown cup with a yellow bottom.</p>

<p>The nucleus easily comes out when the husk is opened, and as
easily separates into two parts or lobes longitudinally; each of
which is represented, Fig. 31. They lie in the husk with the flat
surfaces together, each of which has a sinus at the smaller end
shaped like the sole of one&#8217;s shoe; one of these contains the little
piece which has the rudiments of the tree, adhering closely to its
sinus; the other is empty, and serves only to give room to these
rudiments when the flat surfaces of both lobes are together:
Fig. 32 represents that little piece taken out and viewed by a
larger magnifier, and appears to be convex on the visible side;
having in its outline much the same form with the cell or sinus
which contained it. It has a ridge in a longitudinal direction, is
smaller at one end than the other, has risings on the sides, and is
a most entertaining object.</p>

upon the stalks are spheroids, but those on the leaves and calix
are globular. They seem like so many transparent stones set
into a case, like those of a ring; others are more prominent.
Upon breaking them, they appear to be little membranous bladders,
very clear, and filled with an aqueous liquor. When they

flaccid and collapsed.</p>

<p id="Footnote156"><a href="#FNanchor156" class="label">[156]</a> Dr.

<p>Fig. 33 shews a flower of its natural size, with a bit of its
stalk and a leaf; the leaf has its apex bent towards one side, is
fat or thick, and has in its sinus the bud of another. The seed-vessel
is also fleshy, and the calix has but three leaves, which is
an exception to the general rule mentioned above, each of which
has its apex in the center, or nearly so, differing from those of
the stalk. The flower is indeed polypetalous, having an infinite
number of narrow little leaves crowded together, of a whitish
faint purple, in some parts nearly white, but very inconsiderable.</p>

<p>Fig. 34 is the seed, which is enlarged microscopically, having
a streaky surface, and being of a triangular form. At one angle
there is a dent or rictus, the end of which is the umbilicus of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page661">[661]</span>
seed. It is of a yellowish brown colour, and is very minute in
its natural size, which is seen in those little specks near it.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><span class="smcap">Palma Arecifera.</span></h4>

<p class="hinline">Fig. 35, 36, 37. Areca Catechu. Linn.
Syst. Vegetab. Areca Nut. The areca nut grows in a husk like
the walnut or nutmeg. Fig. 35 is that hard nut which we are
now to describe. Its surface is a dark brown, striated promiscuously
with a yellowish brown colour; its figure a cone, and is
capable of standing firmly upon its basis. In the center of the
basis there is the hole or vestige of its pedicle, or whatever other
thing stuck to it whilst inveloped in its husk, round which the
bottom is whitish. Fig. 36 is another species of the areca nut,
at least in shape, being somewhat less, more squat, and having
no cone. I cannot say, whether these different shaped cones
might not be a variation of the fruit of the same tree, as apples
or any other fruits often are; but the surfaces are not precisely
alike in one respect only, their colour being the same, that is, the
yellowish brown lines upon the surface of the latter are thicker
together, and sink deeper into the cortex between the dark brown
parts, which are consequently made more imminent thereby than
those of the conical one.</p>

<p>Upon cutting one of these into two parts, the surface appears
at Fig. 37. On the outer part all round the internal substance
appears radiated outward, being of a dark red and brown colour,
and in its center inclosing a white substance, which in many
places shoots itself out into the brown substance in little radii
towards the cortex.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><span class="smcap">Juniperus.</span></h4>

<p class="hinline">Fig. 38, 39. J. Communis. Linn. Juniper Berry.
Fig. 38, <i>a</i>, is a juniper berry magnified to shew its marks the more
plainly. This fruit is quite round, of a black colour, which, although
it appears smooth, yet the covering appears porous, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page662">[662]</span>
resembles the surface of shagreen in some measure. At the top
it has a triangular sulcus, which is not very deep, and in some it
is superficial. At the other extremity the stem appears, which is
rough near the place of its insertion, with a scaly covering for a
little space. <i>b</i>, is a transverse section of a juniper berry, which
shews the thickness of the pulpy substance of the fruit, which
appears every where interspersed and mixed with a great quantity
of fine yellow gum, that in many places is in lumps, especially
about the ossicula or stones of the fruit. This parenchyma
incloses three of these ossicula, lying in close contact together
by their flatter sides, and with their apices meeting at the top.
<i>c</i>, is the fruit of its natural size, some grains may be a little
bigger, some a little less.</p>

<p>Fig. 39 is the convex side of one of the stones, having from
the apex three or four ridges, which render it triangular at the
top, and are lost towards the basis, of an irregular form, long,
narrow, and shining, after being cleansed of the pulp that covers
them with the gummy matter just mentioned; but when dry,
has an appearance like that of the stones of other fruit. Fig. 40
shews a longitudinal section of one of them, which brings to view
a nucleus in all respects like that of a plumb-stone, being cloathed
with a membrane, and having a succulent parenchyma. <i>a</i>, is the
stone in its natural size.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><span class="smcap">Santonicum.</span></h4>

<p class="hinline">Fig. 41, 42. Artemisia S. Linn. Worm-seed.
Fig. 41 shews the form of a middling seed enlarged by the microscope,
for they are of different sizes among one another. This
is one of the most singular in its structure, having scarce any
thing substantial in it. The four little figures near it are those of
a natural size, which are very small, and therefore renders the
examination of them the more difficult. The seed has a small
end or handle, being the place to which the stem which supports<span class="pagenum" id="Page663">[663]</span>
it was fixed, and the other end is bulky and round, having from
the hoary handles several bulges all round, which are soft, and
so very tender, that the rubbing of the seeds together reduces
the surfaces to powder, whereby a large seed may be reduced to
a very small one. The seed seems to be entirely composed of
thin brittle membranes of an extreme delicate contexture, as at
Fig. 42, having a dark center, from which it is transparent outward
to the edge all round, and radiated upwards by infinitely
fine radii, which do not render it in the least opake. Thus from
the very outer surface the seed is composed of these sort of membranes,
one after another, till nothing remains behind. Their
colour before the naked eye is of a yellowish cast, but before the
microscope for opake objects shines in many places like gold.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><span class="smcap">Scabiosa Major Vulgaris.</span></h4>

<p class="hinline">Fig. 43 to 46. S. Arvensis. Linn.
Scabious. There is no seed perhaps which has more beauties than
this of the scabious. Fig. 43 is a view of what botanists call
one of the florets, which is a calix to the seed, whose fibres appear
to extend themselves over its edges. This cup is of an octagonal
form, and makes an appearance like a fine vase, having scallopped
edges, and towards the inner part of the edge a whitish ruffled
membrane. The ribs run down from its mouth, which is
bell-fashioned, and becoming narrower downward, form obtuse
angles, by continuing from the bend to form the bottom of the
vase. Between these ribs down the bend the vase is clear,
though not quite transparent, and from thence to the bottom the
ribs are hairy, and make an agreeable figure.</p>

<p>Fig. 44 is the seed taken out of the vase, and drawn in another
proportion, wherein appears first its thick body, which is somewhat
hoary by the microscope, and runs up with a narrow neck,
till it divides into five spiculated fibres, called by Gerard purple
thrumbs, whose spicul&aelig; or spines are determined upwards, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page664">[664]</span>
are thereby ready to cause the seed to recede from any thing that
might injure it upon being touched. The bodies of the vases
when first ripe are of a fine lemon yellow, but grow by long
keeping darker; and the bason formed by the roots of the fine
fibres is of a fine green, but the fibres themselves of a shining
brown, like brown sugar-candy, as their spines are also.</p>

<p>Fig. 45 represents the stalk to which the vases stick by their
bottoms, all which, when together, form the head mentioned by
botanists to be the characters of some species of the scabious.
In this figure the body of the stalk appears all stuck full of narrow
whitish leaves, and the round spots between their roots are
the vestiges of the bottoms of the vases; so that the leaves and
vases are mixed together all over the stalk.</p>

<p>Fig. 46 shews a vase with a piece of its side cut out from the
edge to the bottom. The bulbous part of the seed is contained
in a delicate white membranous case, arising from the inner
membrane of the bottom of the vase, and running up about half
way the neck of the seed, embracing it pretty close, with a
mouth consisting of six or eight sides as beautifully formed as
that of any fine cut-glass decanter. The seed is loose in this
theca, so that it may be turned round within it, but cannot be
pulled out without tearing this beautiful theca, upon account of
its narrow neck.</p>

<h2><span class="chapno">CHAP. XII.</span><br />
<span class="chapname">INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING AND PRESERVING INSECTS&mdash;A
COPIOUS LIST OF MICROSCOPIC OBJECTS. BY THE EDITOR.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="startcapital">T</span>hose who have been long accustomed to microscopical investigations
will readily admit, that the numerous class of insects,
and their several parts, afford some of the most diversified, as
well as the most admirable objects for the microscope. To readers
of this description, who should be considered as adepts, the
following instructions may possibly afford little that is novel, as
by constant habit they must be thoroughly conversant in the best
manner of procuring and preserving the various objects; it may
be, however, reasonably presumed, that there are many persons
who have not hitherto devoted their attention to this subject, as
well as numbers who, deterred by the imaginary difficulties attending
it, have either totally relinquished the pursuit, or made
but small progress therein; to such, the directions here given it is
hoped will prove an acquisition.</p>

<p>Confident as I am of the delights which this employment affords
to the intelligent and industrious admirer of the works of
nature, it is to be deplored that so many persons, who possess
every requisite for these enjoyments, should remain totally insensible
to their attractions; how much might be atchieved, could<span class="pagenum" id="Page666">[666]</span>
such be prevailed upon to devote their hours of leisure to so rational
a purpose? especially if it be considered how easily these
pleasures are to be attained, as well as the tranquillity with
which they may be enjoyed.</p>

<p>Investigations of this kind particularly recommend themselves
to the attention of the ladies, as being congenial with that refinement
of taste and sentiment, and that pure and placid consistency
of conduct which so eminently distinguish and adorn
those of this happy isle. To the honour of several ladies of eminence
be it recorded, that they are proficients in the study of the
various branches of natural history, and many others are making
considerable progress in this pleasing science; than which, none
can possess a greater tendency to sweeten the hours of solitude
and anxiety. How infinitely superior to a rational mind is the
gratification arising from such pursuits, to those, to which numbers
unhappily sacrifice their health and beauty, and frequently
the peace of mind of themselves and relatives, by a baneful attachment
to the gaming table; and that not owing to intellectual
incapacity, but merely from not possessing fortitude sufficient to
prefer the improvement of their minds to amusements, for which
no better plea can possibly be urged, than that of their being
sanctioned by the idol, Fashion.</p>

<p>Actuated by no other motives, than the sincerest respect I entertain
for my fair countrywomen, and anxiety for their real
welfare, I have presumed thus freely to deliver my sentiments;
with greater confidence in the merits of the cause I plead, and
reliance on their prudent discrimination, than on the persuasive
eloquence of the advocate, I am willing to flatter myself that
these remarks may not be entirely ineffectual; at least in warning
those who have happily as yet escaped so dangerous a gulf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page667">[667]</span></p>

<p>Again, how many of my own sex, divested of a taste for rational
enjoyments, groan under the oppressive load of listlessness
and dissatisfaction; for, independent of the more serious and requisite
duties of our respective callings, we require amusements
to refresh us in our vacant moments, which if not devoted to
some laudable pursuit, will necessarily, like those of too many of
our young men of fortune, be sauntered away, or consumed in
senseless and illicit delights, eventually productive of infallible
ruin to both body and mind; viewed in this light, it may indeed
be said, that the situation of men of opulence is of all stations
the least to be envied. I cannot, therefore, but earnestly recommend
to those entrusted with that important charge, the
education of youth, to enforce both by precept and example, their
employment of that time which is not engaged in necessary
avocations, to some purpose, that, whilst it amuses, may likewise
instruct and improve their understandings. These measures
are more peculiarly important in times like the present, when
idleness, dissipation, and infidelity are with gigantic strides endeavouring
to encompass mankind with chains of slavery of all
others the most dreadful and pernicious.</p>

<p>I shall close these observations in the elegant language of an
admired writer.</p>

<p>&#8220;A man that has formed a habit of turning every new object
to his entertainment, finds in the productions of nature an inexhaustible
stock of materials upon which he can employ himself,
without any temptations to envy or malevolence; faults, perhaps,
seldom totally avoided by those whose judgment is much exercised
upon the works of art. He has always a certain prospect
of discovering new reasons for adoring the sovereign Author of
the universe, and probable hopes of making some discovery of
benefit to others, or profit to himself. There is no doubt but<span class="pagenum" id="Page668">[668]</span>
many vegetables and animals have qualities that might be of great
use, to the knowledge of which there is not required much force
of penetration or fatigue of study, but only frequent experiments
and close attention. What is said by the chemists of their darling
mercury, is, perhaps, true of every body through the whole
creation, that, if a thousand lives should be spent upon it, all its
properties would not be found out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mankind must necessarily be diversified by various tastes,
since life affords and requires such multitudes of employments,
and a nation of naturalists is neither to be hoped or desired; but
it is surely not improper to point out a fresh amusement to those
who languish in health, and repine in plenty, for want of some
source of diversion that may be less easily exhausted, and to
inform the multitudes of both sexes, who are burthened with
every new day, that there are many shews which they have not
seen. He that enlarges his curiosity after the works of nature,
demonstrably multiplies the inlets to happiness.&#8221;<a href="#Footnote157" id="FNanchor157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>The characters by which the several classes of insects are distinguished,
have been already explained in <a href="#Page218">pages 218</a> and <a href="#Page219">219</a>;
their transformations have likewise been fully described; I shall
now proceed to enumerate the best methods of obtaining them
in their different states. Justice to the merits of two eminent
naturalists<a href="#Footnote158" id="FNanchor158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> obliges me to mention, that to them I am indebted
for a considerable part of these instructions.</p>

and Preserving Insects. Both these tracts are now become very scarce.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Of all the different classes or orders of insects, that called
<span class="smcapall">LEPIDOPTERA</span> is not only one of the most numerous, but the
most beautiful, with respect to the variety as well as richness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page669">[669]</span>
their colours; and, as from the peculiar delicacy of their structure,
they require greater care to be used in catching, as well as in
preserving them, it will be proper first to speak of, and be more
particular in the directions concerning them.</p>

<h3>THE METHOD OF PROCURING MOTHS AND BUTTERFLIES.</h3>

<p>There are two methods of collecting insects of this kind; first,
by breeding; secondly, by catching them in their fly state: of
these, the former is by much the preferable mode; as, besides the
pleasure which arises from observing the gradual progress of the
insects from their egg or caterpillar to their perfect or fly state,
they may be killed before they have sustained the smallest injury
in the farina or meal of their wings by flying.</p>

<p>The difficulty likewise in procuring the most beautiful and valuable
insects of this class in their fly state, renders this method
by far the most eligible. Most of the sphinges of Linn&aelig;us, or,
as they are usually called, hawk-moths, are but seldom met with
in their fly state, and when seen on the wing, generally elude the
swiftest pursuit; but in their caterpillar state they are frequently
found, and easily taken. Thus the caterpillar of the sphinx atropos
or jasmine hawk-moth, the largest and most beautiful species
of moth this country produces,<a href="#Footnote159" id="FNanchor159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> is often found feeding on
the jasmine and potatoe, and sometimes on green elder; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page670">[670]</span>
sphinx elpenor or elephant hawk-moth, on the Galium palustre
or white ladies-bed-straw; the sphinx ocellata or eyed hawk-moth,
on the willow and apple-trees; sphinx tili&aelig; or lime
hawk-moth, on the lime-tree; sphinx lagustri or privet hawk-moth,
on the privet; phal&aelig;na pavonia or emperor-moth, on the
briar, black-thorn, willow, &amp;c. and so of a great number of
others.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote159"><a href="#FNanchor159" class="label">[159]</a> Desirous
as every collector must be of obtaining these moths, it is certain there are many
persons still existing, who would consider it as a great calamity were one of them to fly into,
or even approach their habitation; and so far from affording the pretty fugitive an asylum,
would experience the highest satisfaction at his speedy departure. The reason, if it be not a
prostitution of the term, is, that as the plumage on the back of this moth exhibits somewhat of
the resemblance of a death&#8217;s head, these intelligent prognosticators (naturalists they cannot be
called) are fully convinced that this harmless insect must be the harbinger of mortality, and
that its appearance infallibly portends speedy death to some one of the family! Indeed, to
weak minds, especially if previously debilitated by sickness, such an idea, if permitted to prey
upon their spirits, may be productive of fatal consequences, and thus stamp a credit on the prophetic
abilities of those sagacious observers of the mysteries of nature. To medical men, who
are daily witnesses of the wonderful influence which the mind possesses over the body in a
diseased state, such events do not appear at all surprizing.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<h3>THE METHOD OF COLLECTING MOTHS, &amp;C. IN THEIR
CATERPILLAR STATE.</h3>

<p>Independent of the method of collecting caterpillars by an attentive
examination of the leaves, and other parts of plants, at
those times of the year when they are in full verdure, there is
another, viz. by beating the boughs of trees, particularly the taller
ones, with long poles, having previously spread a large sheet
underneath to receive them as they drop from the trees. By
these means many very valuable caterpillars are frequently obtained,
which could not otherwise be procured without considerable
difficulty. Caterpillars should be handled as little as
possible, particularly those with smooth skins; the more hairy
ones in general sustain less injury by it. To convey them home
with safety, the collector should be provided with a chip box in
his pocket; and it would be proper to have it partly filled with
fresh leaves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page671">[671]</span></p>

<h3>THE METHOD OF REARING OR BREEDING THEM.</h3>

<p>Having procured the caterpillars, our next endeavour must be
to rear them. For this purpose; it will be indispensably necessary
to afford them an ample supply of the plant on which they are
found feeding, and to renew their food as often as the decay of
that first procured for them may render it expedient. Insects in
this state usually feed voraciously; the caterpillar of the papilio
brassica has been known to consume in one day twice its own
weight of food. Although many of them live on a variety of
food, the greatest part are attached to some particular kind; deprived
of which, some species would form objects less beautiful
when arrived at their perfect state, and others infallibly perish.</p>

<p>As to many it may prove very inconvenient to supply the caterpillars
with fresh food daily, to avoid this trouble, several
sprigs of the tree or plant may be put into a wide-mouthed glass
filled with water, and the caterpillars placed on them. Most
plants may in this manner be preserved fresh for three or four days.
The glass, together with the caterpillars and their food, is to be
placed in the breeding box represented in
the <a href="#Fig671">figure</a> annexed, <i>a</i>, shews an opening in
the front covered with gauze; <i>b</i>, the door
on the side; <i>c</i>, a ring for conveniency of
carriage; and a constant supply of fresh food
is to be given them, as soon as the former
appears in the least withered. The breeding
boxes should never be exposed to the scorching
rays of the sun, but placed in a cool and shady situation; nor
should they contain more than one kind of caterpillar, as some
species devour others.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig671">
<img src="images/illo671.jpg" alt="Breeding box" width="300" height="302" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page672">[672]</span></p>

<p>When arrived at their full growth, the caterpillars leave off
eating, and soon after, change into the chrysalis or pupa form;
previous to which, butterflies spin a little web, just sufficient to
suspend themselves by: many of the moths, like the silk-worm,
spin a large web, in which they inwrap themselves; and a great
number penetrate into the earth, where they spin themselves cases,
or change without any spinning, as do most of the sphinges
or hawk-moths. It will therefore be necessary to cover the bottom
of the box with fine mould to the depth of four or five
inches, and keep it constantly moist.</p>

<p>It frequently happens that caterpillars are what the aurelians
call stung, that is, have the eggs of the ichneumon-fly deposited
in them, of which operation a full account has been given in
<a href="#Page295">pages 295</a>-<a href="#Page298">298</a>. Caterpillars, previous to their going into the
chrysalis state, generally lose the brilliancy of their colours, and
many of them rove about for some time.</p>

<p>After remaining in their chrysalis state till near the time of
their coming forth, such as are inclosed in a hard case or spinning,
as the phal&aelig;na vinula, puss moth; phal&aelig;na quercus, great
egger moth, &amp;c. are to be carefully freed from it; as the aperture
which the insect naturally makes is often too narrow for it
to pass through without sustaining considerable injury in its plumage.
The opening will be best made, by cutting off the larger
extremity of the case, taking especial care not to wound the inclosed
pupa or chrysalis.</p>

<p>The learned Dr. Bellardi, Foreign Member of the Linnean Society,
&amp;c. a few years since discovered a new method of feeding
silk-worms, when they are hatched before the mulberry-trees
have produced leaves, or when the tender branches are destroyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page673">[673]</span>
by frost: how far this practice may be successfully applied in
other instances, seems as yet undetermined; though from some
recent experiments, it appears possible that caterpillars may be
thus fed in backward seasons. This method consists in giving
the caterpillar-the dried leaves of their accustomed food reduced
to powder, and gently moistened with water; a thin coating of
which must be placed round the young worms, who will immediately
begin to feed upon it. The Doctor informs us that the caterpillars
of the silk-worm prefer it to any other food, and devour it
with the utmost avidity. The leaves should be gathered towards
the close of the autumn, before the frost commences, in dry
weather, and when the heat is greatest; they must be dried in
the sun by spreading them upon large cloths, and after being reduced
into powder, laid up in a dry place. Donovan says,<a href="#Footnote160" id="FNanchor160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> that
the experiment has been tried with several caterpillars which
were nearly full fed on the leaves of thorns and oaks thus prepared,
and that they were observed to eat it when no other food
was given, but he cannot determine how far they may thrive if
fed on that aliment only.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<h3>THE METHOD OF COLLECTING THEM IN THEIR
CHRYSALIS STATE.</h3>

<p>Butterflies and moths may often be found in chrysalis under
the projection of garden walls, pales, out-houses, in summer-houses,
&amp;c. and frequently affixed to the food on which the caterpillar
fed. A great variety of moths in the pupa state may
with more certainty be found, during the winter months, by
digging under the trees on which they feed, particularly under
the oak, willow, lime, and elm trees. When they are procured
in this manner, they should be placed as soon as convenient in<span class="pagenum" id="Page674">[674]</span>
the breeding box before described, and kept covered with moist
earth till the ensuing spring; when, as soon as the weather is
mild, they may be dug up and placed somewhat nearer the surface
of the mould, and in that manner left to come out of themselves.
Should the collector not succeed in procuring chrysalides
by this method, it will frequently happen that his labour will be
amply recompensed by obtaining a variety of beetles.</p>

<h3>THE METHOD OF COLLECTING THEM IN THEIR FLY
OR PERFECT STATE.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig674">
<img src="images/illo674.jpg" alt="Net" width="350" height="294" />
</div>

<p>The extreme delicacy of the wings of moths and butterflies
will not admit of their being caught without injury, but in nets
made of the finest materials. It will be necessary, therefore,
that the collector should provide himself with a net properly
adapted to this purpose: the one <a href="#Fig674">here</a>
represented has, after long experience,
been found to answer extremely well.
Fig. A shews the net expanded ready
for use; <i>a</i> exhibits the part made of
fine Scotch gauze, which should be
previously dyed green; <i>b</i> <i>b</i>, the sticks;
these should be of some light wood.
To render them compact and convenient for carriage, they
are made to take to pieces somewhat in the manner of fishing-rods,
and connected by means of screws or hollow brass ferrils
fixed to the end of each: there are three of them for each side of
the net. Fig. B shews one of the sticks; <i>a</i>, the brass ferril; <i>b</i>, the
end of the next stick, which fixes tight into it; to the upper end
of the sticks, at <i>c</i>, is joined in like manner a piece of cane bent
to a proper shape. Instead of three pieces of wood, as here described,
the other stick may consist of one entire piece, and be
used as a walking-stick. The gauze must be edged with two<span class="pagenum" id="Page675">[675]</span>
pieces of binding sewed together, to receive the sticks when
joined; and, as the sticks are taper, so must be the cavity to receive
them. At the lower part the gauze is to be turned up
about six inches, so as to form a bag, Fig. A, <i>c</i>. At the extremity
of the gauze, next the handles, two pieces of tape must be
fixed on each side, <i>d</i> <i>d</i>, of sufficient length to pass through a
hole bored in the stick, and then be tied in a loop, so as to prevent
the gauze from sliding on the sticks. At the upper part of
the net where the canes meet, <i>e</i>, the cavity should be closed by a
few stitches, that the sticks may shut even together. The net
may be about a yard in width when expanded, and the length of
it a yard and an half: the size, however, may be varied at pleasure.
The gauze should be deprived of its glazing by being
soaked for a short time in warm water; but, if dyed green,
which is usually the case, this will be unnecessary. The handles
are to be held one in each hand, when the net is used.<a href="#Footnote161" id="FNanchor161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote161"><a href="#FNanchor161" class="label">[161]</a> Though
this net be principally intended for catching moths and butterflies on the wing, it
maybe usefully applied to another purpose: if one person expand the net under a bush or
branch intended for examination, and another shake the bush, or beat it well with a stick,
numbers of caterpillars, as well as some of the minuter kinds of coleopterous, and other insects,
will fall into the net. By these means moths are likewise often taken, as they remain in a
torpid state during the day, sheltered in the bushes.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/illo675.jpg" alt="Forceps" width="250" height="267" />
</div>

<p>Besides the gauze net for catching butterflies, &amp;c., the collector
should be provided with a pair of forceps, made of
steel, about nine or ten inches in length, and of the
shape represented in the figure;<a href="#Footnote162" id="FNanchor162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> the fans are to be
covered with fine green gauze. This instrument will
in many instances be found exceedingly commodious,
as being of more general use; it is very portable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page676">[676]</span>
and possesses this advantage over the net, that the insect caught
in it will be more confined, and consequently not so liable to
injure its down. If the insect be met with on the trunk of a
tree, paling, or any flat surface, it may be readily caught; if on a
leaf, both may be enclosed in the forceps. Whilst in the forceps,
it should be pressed with the thumb, or, if the creature be small,
with the thumb-nail, sufficient to stupify, but not crush it.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote162"><a href="#FNanchor162" class="label">[162]</a> This
figure shews the forceps in the proportions in which they have been generally made;
I would, however, recommend the fans to be considerably larger, and the handles shorter. The
form of the fans has commonly been either hexagonal, or, the worst of all, triangular; experience
has taught me that the shape as here given is to be preferred, as being less liable to miss
the insects, who are usually upon their guard, and frequently elude the vigilance of their
pursuers. A front view of the fans is given, the better to shew their form; but it is obvious
that they must be placed in a contrary direction, so as to flap on, not slide over, each
other.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The next articles necessary to be provided, will be two or
three oval chip boxes, cut sufficiently flat for the pocket, and
lined at top and bottom with thin cork; and a cushion well
stored with pins of various sizes.</p>

<p>The collector being now furnished with the necessary instruments,
it will be proper to give him such instructions as may
enable him to use them. With regard to the manner of using
the net with expertness and success, this knowledge will be
much better acquired by practice than by the most ample description.
Harris, in his elegant work, The Aurelian, has been
rather diffusive than clear on this subject. Having caught the
butterfly or moth in the net, it will be necessary to proceed with
caution, as on killing it properly its beauty in a great measure
depends. It should not be laid hold of indiscriminately in any
part; but by managing skilfully the net, its wings must, if possible,
be brought into an erect position or close together; then
press the under part of the thorax or breast between the thumb
and the fore-finger sufficiently hard to kill the insect. By carefully
attending to these directions, the wings will not be distorted
or the plumage injured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page677">[677]</span></p>

<p>The net being now opened, the insect is to be laid hold of by
one of its antenn&aelig; or horns, and again placed between the thumb
and fore-finger; in which situation it is to be held, while a pin
proportioned to its size is stuck through the upper part of the
thorax or back; it may then be affixed to the pocket-box by
sticking the point of the pin into the cork lining. The larger
kinds of these insects, especially moths and hawk-moths, which
are far more tenacious of life than butterflies, will not expire so
readily by this method, as by fixing them upon the bottom of a
cork exactly fitted to the mouth of a bottle into which a little
sulphur has been put; by gradually heating the bottle till an
exhalation of the sulphur takes place, the insect usually dies
without injuring its colour or plumage.</p>

<h3>THE METHOD OF MANAGING THEM IN THEIR FLY STATE.</h3>

<p>Though by the means just described these insects may be
caught uninjured, some farther care is requisite in order to make
them appear to advantage; this is called setting them, and is
performed in the following manner. The insect being stuck
through with a pin of a proper size, is to be placed before its
wings are become stiff, on a piece of cork, having a smooth surface
and covered with white paper. The body of the fly should
not be made to touch the cork when the insect is affixed to it,
but to stand up some little distance from
it, as only the edges of both wings are
intended to touch, not the wings to lie
flat on the cork. The wings are then to
be expanded, as in the <a href="#Fig677">figure</a>, with a fine
needle, or some sharp-pointed instrument.
The instruments used in the operation
for the eye called couching, being fixed to taper handles,
are peculiarly commodious for this purpose.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig677">
<img src="images/illo677.jpg" alt="Butterfly" width="500" height="391" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page678">[678]</span></p>

<p>The upper edges of the superior wings are to be placed in a line
with the head of the insect, and they are to be kept in this situation
by means of little braces, formed of card-paper and cut in
the shape represented in the figure; a number of which should
always be kept in readiness in a small box. These must be proportioned
to the size of the wings, and fitted to their shape, by
being more or less bent; by a proper attention to which, the
spots, &amp;c. on both wings are rendered conspicuous, and the beauties
of the insect exhibited in full perfection. To acquire the
method, however, of setting them well, requires considerable
practice and some ingenuity. After remaining in this position
four or five days, or till the insect is become thoroughly stiff, the
braces may be taken off, and the insect removed into the store
box. The shape of the store box is immaterial; it should, however,
be flat, and may be made either of wood, or, which is preferable,
of tin. The inside should be lined with thin cork and
covered with paper, and some slips of cloth glued to its edges
to make it shut closer, and thus exclude as much as possible insects
and animalcula; a little camphor tied in a bit of rag, and
pinned to a corner of the box, will be found very useful to prevent
their depredations.</p>

<p>It is particularly to be observed, that there is a continual succession
of insects as well as of plants; some appear with the early
primrose, others accompany the late-flowering ivy: so that in
this respect, the aurelian and entomologist may regulate their excursions
by those of the botanist; the latter would in vain search
for the ranunculus ficaria or pile-wort, in the month of July, and
the former be equally disappointed in seeking for the papilio
cardamines, orange-tip, in the month of August.</p>

<p>Some of these insects continue longer in their fly state, and
their plumage is less injured by flying, than others; some continue<span class="pagenum" id="Page679">[679]</span>
for a few days only; others, several weeks. In general,
moths and butterflies, unless they are caught the first day of their
coming out of chrysalis, are of small value; hence arises the necessity
of carefully watching those particulars, and of making
frequent excursions in order to obtain them in the greatest perfection.</p>

<p>Butterflies are to be caught on the wing only when the sun
shines warm. They inhabit a variety of places; the greatest
number of them frequent woods, and may be taken in or near
them, as the papilio iris, purple emperor; papilio hyperantus,
ringlet; and most, if not all the fritillaries. Some delight in
meadows, as the papilio jurtina, meadow brown; galathea, marbled
white; C. album, comma; rhamni, brimstone: and others
frequent gardens, as the brassic&aelig; and rap&aelig;, large and small garden
white; others, again, clover fields, corn fields, heaths, lanes,
&amp;c. Many of those which frequent woods are taken with much
greater facility in the morning, a few hours after sun-rise; at
which time they are found feeding on the flowers that grow by
the sides of the woods; afterwards, when the sun shines with
greater strength, they fly high, and with such rapidity, as not to
be taken but with the utmost difficulty.</p>

<p>Moths fly chiefly in the evening, a little after sun-set. Like
butterflies, they inhabit a variety of places, and are to be met
with in the greatest plenty near woods; they may also be taken
in great numbers in the day-time by beating the hedges, &amp;c.
more particularly in the afternoon, as the least motion will then
put them on the wing. They are likewise frequently met with
in the day-time sticking to the bark of trees, on walls, and pales
that surround gardens, &amp;c. and may be thus caught in great perfection.
Some few, like the butterflies, fly in the middle of the
day, when the sun shines warm, over the flowers of honey-suckles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page680">[680]</span>
and other plants with tubular flowers. Insects of this
species seldom sit to feed, but continue vibrating on the wing
while they thrust their tongue or proboscis into the flower.</p>

<p>Geoffroy says that moths may be taken in great plenty by
means of a candle or lanthorn carried into or near some wood,
towards dark. Independent of the recommendation of authority
so respectable, the well-known propensity that moths have to
fly towards, and even into candles, has induced some collectors
to adopt this method with success; many of the most valuable
caterpillars have also been thus obtained.</p>

<h3>THE METHODS OF COLLECTING INSECTS OF THE
BEETLE KIND.</h3>

<p>By these are meant all such, as are included in Linn&aelig;us&#8217;s first
order of insects, under the term <span class="smcapall">COLEOPTERA</span>; these have generally
been called scarab&aelig;i or beetles: some few of them have
obtained distinct English names, as the chaffer, lady-bird, earwig,
&amp;c. and all have been divided by Linn&aelig;us into genera and
species.</p>

<p>The insects of this, as well as the preceding and following
order, may be found in their caterpillar or grub state, in which
they often prove extremely destructive to the roots of plants; and
may in like manner be brought to their perfect or fly state, regard
being had to their different manner of feeding. The time
and care, however, required for this purpose, is probably more
than can be spared by the generality of collectors; the curious
entomologist, possessed of both leisure and abilities to engage in
the pursuit, will be enabled to establish with certainty the different
genera of insects.<span class="pagenum" id="Page681">[681]</span>
These insects are generally collected in their fly state: some
creep and fly in the day-time when the sun shines warm; others,
like the moth, fly in the evening and the night only.</p>

<p>Their habitations are exceedingly diversified: some are found
in rotten and half decayed wood, and under the decayed bark of
trees, as the lucanus cervus, flying stag, scarab&aelig;us cylindricus,
and many of the cerambyces; others, among the dung of various
animals, particularly of horses, cows, and sheep, as the dermestes,
leather-eater; hister, mimic beetle; scarab&aelig;us fimetarius, &amp;c.
Many of them make holes under the dung three or four inches
deep, it will therefore be necessary to have an iron spade to dig
them out, when in search of this kind of insects; some reside in
the bodies of animals that are become putrid, as the silpha vespillo,
carrion beetle, hister, &amp;c. also in moist bones that have
been gnawed by dogs, or other animals, on flowers having a
fetid smell, and on several kinds of fungous substances; others
may be found in the morning about the bottoms of perpendicular
rocks and sand-banks, as the curculio, weevil; and brachus,
sand-beetle. Great numbers are found on the leaves and stalks
of plants, as the scarab&aelig;us melolantha, chaffer; coccinella, lady-bird;
chrysomela, curculiones, &amp;c. others delight more particularly
in the flowers of plants, as the scarab&aelig;us auratus: some reside
altogether in woods, as many of the cerambyces; some are
found swimming on the surface of standing waters, as the gyrinus
natator; others in ditches, ponds, &amp;c. as the dytisci; many
may be caught in rivers, lakes, and standing pools, by means of
a thread net with small meshes, in a round wire hoop fixed to
the end of a long pole; some are discovered by the light which
they emit, as the lampyris noctiluca, glow-worm; and vast quantities
are found on dry banks, sand-banks, sand-pits, &amp;c. particularly
when the sun shines warm; numbers may be found in
houses, dark cellars, damp pits, caves, and subterraneous passages,<span class="pagenum" id="Page682">[682]</span>
as the tenebrio, stinking beetle; or on umbelliferous
flowers and in timber-yards. Multitudes live under stones, moss,
rubbish, and creeks near the shores of lakes and rivers; these are
found also in bogs, marshes, moist places, pits, and holes of the
earth, on stems of trees, and in the evening they crawl plentifully
along pathways after a shower of rain. Some may be discovered
in the hollow stems of umbelliferous plants, as the forficula,
earwig.</p>

<p>These insects, as soon as caught, may with a pin of a proper
size be stuck through the body, close to the suture that runs
down the middle of the back, and then placed in the pocket box,
taking care that they do not injure one another from being placed
too close together. Or, if the collector be disposed to procure
this class of insects, he will find it very convenient, and certainly
much less cruel, to carry a number of small pill-boxes in his
pocket, in which the insects may be readily secured and kept till
he return home, without their suffering any pain; they are then
to be immersed in boiling water, that being a most expeditious
mode of killing them, and far preferable to their immersion in
spirits, in which many of them will live a considerable time;<a href="#Footnote163" id="FNanchor163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
they may afterwards be stuck through in the manner above-mentioned,
being careful to make the pin pass a sufficient length
through the body of the insect, and then placed on a piece of
smooth cork. When they have remained in this situation two,
three, or four days, or longer, according to their size, the legs,
antenn&aelig;, &amp;c. are to be extended with a pair of fine nippers or
tweezers, and placed in a natural position; in which they will, if
proper care be taken of them, always remain: particular caution<span class="pagenum" id="Page683">[683]</span>
should, however, be used not to place them in the store box or
cabinet till perfectly dry, as otherwise they will be liable to be
infested with animalcula, by which they will soon be destroyed.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote163"><a href="#FNanchor163" class="label">[163]</a> &#8220;The
best method is to inclose them in a chip box, and kill them by exposing the box to
the heat of a fire; this treatment will rather absorb than add to the superfluous juices of the
insect, and greatly contribute to its preservation.&#8221; Donovan.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<h3>THE METHOD OF COLLECTING INSECTS CALLED HEMIPTERA.</h3>

<p>The genera contained in this order of insects are principally
these: viz. blatta, the cockroach; mantis, camel cricket; gryllus,
locust, grasshopper, cricket; cicada, flea locust; cimex or bug.</p>

<p>The first of these, the cockroach, has been imported from warmer
climates, where these insects are extremely numerous, and
far more troublesome.<a href="#Footnote164" id="FNanchor164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> They are found in the greatest plenty
here in bakehouses, particularly in the night, their usual time of
feeding; they likewise abound in corn-mills, in ships, and in all
places where meal is deposited.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote164"><a href="#FNanchor164" class="label">[164]</a> In
the island of Senegal they do incredible mischief; they gnaw linen, sheets, wood,
paper, books, and, in short, whatever comes in their way; they attack even the aloes, the bitterness
of which keeps off all other insects. Adanson&#8217;s Voyage, p. 296.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>All those of the next genus, mantis, are foreign; some of them
are extremely remarkable and curious, and from their particular
shape, as well as their colour, have been called walking leaves;
they are found in meadows, on grass, and on the leaves of plants
and trees. The grylli mostly reside in meadows and fields
among the herbage; however formidable the mischief occasioned
by the blatt&aelig; may appear, it is trivial when compared with the
ravages of the gryllus migratorius or locust.<a href="#Footnote165" id="FNanchor165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
One species of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page684">[684]</span>
genus, the gryllus domesticus, resides in houses, particularly
where there are ovens, and entertains the inhabitants with the
chirping sound it emits. Most of the fulgor&aelig; or lanthorn-flies
are discoverable by the light which proceeds from them; these,
like the mant&aelig;, are foreign, and many of them equally curious.
The cicad&aelig; are found on trees and plants; the notonect&aelig; and
nep&aelig; frequent rivers, lakes, and standing waters. There is
scarce a person who has resided any time in a very populous
place, but knows where to find one species of the next genus or
cimex, viz. that distinguished by the name of cimex lectularius or
bed bug.<a href="#Footnote166" id="FNanchor166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote165"><a href="#FNanchor165" class="label">[165]</a>
Adanson relates, that soon after his arrival in Senegal, he was a witness to the mischief
done by locusts, that scourge so dreadful to hot climates! Towards eight o&#8217;clock in the morning
there suddenly arose a thick cloud that darkened the air, and obstructed the rays of the sun;
the cause of which was soon found to be myriads of locusts, raised about twenty or thirty fathoms
from the ground, and covering an extent of several leagues, upon which a shower of these
insects fell, devouring while they rested themselves, and then resuming their flight. This cloud
was brought by a very strong easterly wind; it was all the morning passing over the
adjacent country, and it was supposed the same wind drove the locusts into the sea. They
spread desolation wherever they came; after devouring the herbage, with the fruits and leaves
of trees, they attacked even the buds and the very bark; they did not so much as spare the dry
reeds with which the huts were thatched. Hasselquist in his Voyage to the Levant, says that
&#8220;the inhabitants of Asia sometimes take the field against locusts with all the apparatus of war.
The bashaw of Tripoli in Syria some years ago raised 4000 soldiers against these insects, and
ordered those to be hanged who refused to go.&#8221; Amidst the numerous blessings our own favoured
isle enjoys, what a happiness it is to be exempted from the ravages of these pernicious
insects, as well as from the government of bashaws! In the year 1748 great numbers of the
grylli migratorii were seen in London and its vicinity, but they were not productive of any
mischief, and soon perished.</p>

<p id="Footnote166"><a href="#FNanchor166" class="label">[166]</a> These
unpleasant domestics were scarcely observed in England previous to the fire of
London in the year 1666. It is conjectured that they were afterwards introduced with the
limber imported for re-building the houses: allowing this to be the fact, posterity may console
themselves with the inconveniences they sustain from this evil, by reflecting how much benefit
they have derived in other respects from the unhappy catastrophe which produced it.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>These insects may be killed either with boiling water or a few
drops of the etherial oil or spirit of turpentine. They are all of
them to be stuck through the thorax or back, betwixt the shoulders;<span class="pagenum" id="Page685">[685]</span>
the wings of the grylli and some of the others are to be
expanded, and kept so by the little braces, and their legs, antenn&aelig;,
&amp;c. placed in a natural situation.</p>

<h3>THE METHOD OF COLLECTING INSECTS CALLED
NEUROPTERA.</h3>

<p>Those of this class, the fourth order of Linn&aelig;us, are chiefly
aquatic, residing in the waters as caterpillars, and flying about
them in their perfect state. The principal genera are, the libellula,
dragon-fly; ephemera, may-fly; phryganea, spring-fly; hemerobius,
and panorpa. The libellul&aelig; are considered by the
generality of people as containing in them something venomous;
and from hence, in addition to the epithet, alone sufficiently tremendous,
of dragon-fly, have obtained the several names of
adder-spear, adder-bolt, horse-stinger, &amp;c. It must be confessed,
that their shape, manner of flight, &amp;c. are such as might readily
raise such an idea in the minds of the multitude, who but too
often form their decisions from appearances only; but naturalists
are unaccustomed to such hasty determinations, and they can
safely advise the collector not to be misled by terrific words, nor
intimidated from catching them, they being perfectly harmless,
indeed more so than the gnats which constitute a part of their
food. The butterfly net already described will be very convenient
for catching insects of this order, particularly the libellul&aelig;.</p>

<p>They are all of them easily killed, either by pressure of the
thorax, or with spirit of turpentine, spirit of wine, or the fumes
of sulphur; the same means are to be used in setting them as in
the hemiptera.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page686">[686]</span></p>

<h3>THE METHOD OF COLLECTING INSECTS CALLED
HYMENOPTERA.</h3>

<p>The remarks which have just been made on the libellul&aelig; do
not apply to insects of this order, the major part of them being
armed with stings; some of which are, however, harmless, though
others are venomous. The principal genera are, the tenthredo,
saw-fly; ichneumon, ichneumon-fly; sphex, ichneumon-wasp;
vespa, wasp, hornet; apis, bee; formica, ant; sirex, and chrysis.
The tenthredines are found on trees and flowers in their caterpillar
state; they feed on the leaves of plants. The ichneumons
are found in the same manner; in their caterpillar state,
they live chiefly in the bodies of other insects, particularly in the
caterpillars of the moths and butterflies, as has been already
mentioned. The sphex resides principally in sand-banks, it is
also caught on flowers, shrubs and fruits, and about hedges; this
insect catches and kills others, which it buries in the sand,
having previously deposited its eggs in them. Wasps, bees, and
ants, are found on flowers and fruits, and almost on every
sweet substance. The chrysis, of which many species are exceeding
beautiful, is found flying about old walls, posts, sand-banks,
&amp;c. in which it builds its nest. Wasps and bees are the
only winged insects that have any great degree of poison in them,
they should therefore be taken with the forceps before described,
and handled cautiously on account of their stings, which are
dangerous. Some, as the mytilla, naked bee, have stings, but no
poison, and are to be found on the flowers of umbelliferous
plants, when the sun shines hot in the middle of the day; at
which time others, as the chrysis, &amp;c. are also to be met with:
when caught, a pin is to be stuck through them whilst in the net.
It is very difficult to kill these insects without injuring them in<span class="pagenum" id="Page687">[687]</span>
some respect; boiling water hurts their wings, and the fine hairs
with which many of them are covered; spirits of wine or turpentine
prove immediately fatal to some, whilst others are scarce
affected by them; and letting them remain transfixed till they are
dead, will probably be thought too cruel; it is said, that the best
method hitherto practised, is to stick them through with a needle
dipped in aqua fortis; the sphinges, and other large moths, are
likewise killed in the same manner with the least injury: the
reader will adopt either of these methods, or any other he may
deem expedient. When dead, their wings are to be expanded,
and kept in as natural a position as possible.</p>

<h3>THE METHOD OF COLLECTING INSECTS CALLED DIPTERA.</h3>

<p>This order contains various kinds of flies and gnats; the former
abound in almost every place, but they are found more particularly
on all kinds of plants and flowers, especially on the umbelliferous
ones, about the tops of trees, little hills, &amp;c. Some of
them fly about cattle of various kind, in the skins of which they
deposit their eggs, as the oestrus bovis, &amp;c. These insects are
easily killed by a few drops of spirit of turpentine: their wings
are to be expanded so that their bodies may become apparent;
a little brace should be placed underneath them, to prevent their
bodies being too much incurvated in drying, which they are very
apt to be. Many of these are most easily taken when they begin
to feed; for, in the middle of the day they are so quick and active,
that it is almost impossible to catch them.</p>

<p>With regard to the last order of insects, distinguished by the
term <span class="smcapall">APTERA</span>, they are so common, and the places they inhabit so
generally known, that any information on the means of collecting
them must be superfluous. Under this class are included spiders,<span class="pagenum" id="Page688">[688]</span>
scorpions, centipes, crabs, lobsters, &amp;c. &amp;c. Most of these require
to be preserved in some kind of spirit; spirit of wine, proof spirit,
or geneva, are to be preferred, on account of their pellucidness;
though rum or brandy may, if no other spirit be at hand, answer
the purpose of preserving, though not that of exhibiting them
with equal advantage.</p>

<p>Those of the genus cancer, after being well dried or carefully
baked, may be conveniently preserved in store boxes, or properly
arranged in a cabinet collection. The smaller kinds of insects
in general, as well as those of the order aptera, are best disposed
of between talcs in sliders; such, for instance, as the termes
pulsatorium,<a href="#Footnote167" id="FNanchor167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
the several podur&aelig;, pediculi, pulices, acari, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote167"><a href="#FNanchor167" class="label">[167]</a>
According to Linn&aelig;us, this is the minute insect which has been long known by the English
name of the death-watch, and described by a number of authors: Linn&aelig;us thus notices it;
&#8220;frequens in domibus, invisum vestibus, herbariis, insectorum museis. F&#339;mina horologii
instar pulsatoria in ligneis festucis.&#8221; Syst. Nat. p. 1015. No. 2. Geoffroy, however, says he is
confident that it is not from this insect, but from the dermestes domesticus, (Syst. Nat. p. 563,
No. 12,) which makes the circular holes in furniture, that the ticking noise proceeds. Hist. des
Insectes, Tom. I. p. 111. &amp; Tom. II. p. 602. Neither of these are larger than the pediculus
humanus. Again, on the respectable authority of Dr. Shaw, we are assured, that the insect
properly called the death-watch is a coleopterous insect of the genus ptinus, Syst. Nat. p. 565.
The Doctor says, &#8220;it is chiefly in the advanced state of the spring that this alarming little
insect commences its sound&mdash;the prevailing number of distinct strokes is from seven to nine or
eleven&mdash;these are given in pretty quick succession, and are repeated at uncertain intervals; and
in old houses, where the insects are numerous, may be heard almost every hour of the day,
especially if the weather be warm. The sound exactly resembles that which may be made by
beating moderately hard with the nail on a table&mdash;It is about a quarter of an inch in length.&#8221;
This very able naturalist has distinguished the insect by the name of ptinus fatidicus, the beating
ptinus, and supposes it to be the same with the dermestes tesselatus of Fabricius, and the
ptinus pulsator of Gmelin. He also cautions us &#8220;not to confound this insect, which is the
real death-watch of the vulgar, emphatically so called, with another insect, which makes a
sound like the ticking of a watch, and which continues its sound for a long time without intermission:
it belongs to a totally different tribe from the death-watch, and is the termes pulsatorium
of Linnaeus.&#8221; Every one will agree with the Doctor in his remark, that, &#8220;it is a very
singular circumstance that an animal so common should not be more universally known.&#8221;
Nat. Misc. vol. iii.</p>

<p>Whichsoever of the three above described is the real insect, it is well known, that for a series
of years the dread of it has excited the most uneasy sensations in the minds of the weak and
superstitious; an unhappy prejudice which exists even to the present hour, and cannot be totally
eradicated by all the powers of reason and argument. Sir Thomas Brown long since
observed, &#8220;He that could extinguish the terrifying apprehensions hereof, might prevent the
passions of the heart, and many cold sweats in grandmothers and nurses.&#8221; Pseudodoxia Epidemica,

<p>As the collector will have frequent occasion for the use of cork,
both to line his boxes with, and to set his insects on, the following<span class="pagenum" id="Page689">[689]</span>
directions how to prepare it for these purposes will be found
useful.</p>

<p>He may procure the cork in large pieces at any of the cork-cutters;
these must be cut into smaller ones, and, in order to
make the cork flat, it is to be held before the fire till the heat
thoroughly penetrate it; the cork is then to be immediately
placed betwixt two smooth boards, and a very heavy weight laid
on it; in which situation it must remain till cold. Thus flattened,
it is to be rasped on both sides, with such a rasp as is used
by the bakers; afterwards, with a finer one; and, lastly, with a
pumice-stone; by which it will be rendered perfectly smooth.
If the cork be thick, and the purpose of it to line boxes, it may
be sawed through the middle, and rasped as before directed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page690">[690]</span></p>

<p>As, without a due attention to the state of the atmosphere,
the collector may make many fruitless excursions, it will be
proper to point out to him the kind of weather best adapted for
the purpose of ensuring success.</p>

<p>If the day prove fine, and the sun emit much warmth, insects
are very brisk and lively; if, on the contrary, the weather should
be cold or windy, it will be in vain to attempt catching them
on the wing, as at such times insects in general take shelter
within the herbage, and instead of flying upwards, which is
usually the case when disturbed, they dart into the thickest underwood;
or should they rise above the bushes, they are impetuously
hurled by the current of the wind far beyond the reach of
the net; and, were it otherwise, the collector would find the
apparatus unmanageable. Harris says the garden white is as
good a token for fine weather as may be; when these flies are
out in the morning, it generally prognosticates a fine day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page691">[691]</span></p>

<p>At day-break many insects are on the wing; and most kinds
are observed in hot weather to come forth after rain, to enjoy
the humidity of the air; this is the best time for collecting, as
their wings are less subject to stiffen before they can be set.</p>

<p>The males of some, if not of every species of moths, and possibly
of other insects, by a faculty to us incomprehensible, are
able to discover the females, not only at a great distance, but
in the most recluse situations. This circumstance has induced
some collectors to endeavour to entrap such of the males as are
not easily procured by any of the common methods: they enclose
the female in a breeding box, and place it as near the usual
haunts of the species as convenient; the males will generally be
observed soon after fluttering on the box, and endeavouring to
gain admission to the females. This artifice has been repeatedly
practised with success on the fox and egger moths.</p>

<p>Every species has its distinct time for appearance, which is
seldom accelerated or retarded a few days, unless by the unusual
mildness or inclemency of the season. If a brood of insects be
discovered at a certain season of the year, a brood of the same
species will be found precisely at, or near the same period of the
year following, except by accident they should have been destroyed.
Notwithstanding the observation holds good in general,
it is a fact that some insects are very variable in this respect; for
instance, the sphinx convolvuli, unicorn hawk-moth, and the
papilio hyale, clouded-yellow butterfly, were common about
London in the year 1781, but have been very scarce since that
time, especially the former; the papilio cardui, painted lady,
sometimes disappears for several years. The papilio antiopa, grand
surprize or Camberwell beauty, was first discovered in the year
1748, in Cold-arbour lane, Camberwell, and has occasionally disappeared
for some years; a few seasons since several were taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page692">[692]</span>
in different parts of the kingdom; subsequent to which period, it
is not known that even one specimen has been seen. It has been
repeatedly ascertained, that, as with plants, so it is with insects,
some kinds are confined to one particular spot of ground, and are
not to be found in any other part of the same wood; consequently,
the haunts being once discovered, the collector may be
encouraged to expect meeting with some of the same species for
several seasons successively.</p>

<p>Minute moths are to be found in winter as well as summer.
It would be scarcely credible, did not experience prove, that
when the frost is so intense, as to entirely subvert the appearance
and almost annihilate the existence of vegetable productions,
within its influence myriads of these delicately-formed creatures
brave the inclement season, and exist securely within those habitations
which they have the address to construct. A skilful entomologist
may at this season in a few hours collect a number of
the coleoptera, hemiptera, and lepidoptera orders; several of
which are not to be obtained, but in very cold weather.</p>

<p>These insects usually shelter themselves among the moss and
other extraneous matters growing on the trunks or branches of
trees, or beneath the rotten bark; these substances should be
shut close in a box or tin canister, to prevent the escape of those
insects that may be revived by the warmth. To examine them,
Donovan recommends spreading a sheet of writing paper on a
table, and placing a lamp or candle, with a shade of transparent
or oiled paper before you, so as to weaken the glare; separate
the moss, and shake it loosely in your hand, and you will perceive
many insects fall down on the paper. If they be too minute
to admit of a pin being thrust through the thorax, they may be
fastened with gum-water to small slips of paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page693">[693]</span></p>

<h3>GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR FITTING UP A CABINET.</h3>

<p>To those who delight in subjects of natural history, a good
cabinet of insects is esteemed a valuable acquisition: if it be well
constructed, and the several objects arranged with judgment, it
certainly exhibits one of the most beautiful and admirable assemblages
of objects in nature. Such, however, who are disposed to
make a collection sufficiently extensive to form a complete one,
will find it necessary to devote a great deal of time to the purpose,
as well as to be endued with a considerable share of perseverance
and ingenuity; those who are possessed of affluence will
find it far less difficult to acquire one. The cabinet, to appear
with that elegance which the subject deserves, should be of mahogany,
well seasoned, and made by a good workman in such a
manner that all the joints may fit with the greatest nicety; the
form and size may be according to fancy, or the extent of the
collection intended to be made.</p>

<p>To form a cabinet sufficiently capacious to receive specimens of
all the English insects hitherto discovered, those excepted which,
as before observed, are better preserved in spirits or between
sliders, I would recommend one on the following plan:</p>

<p>The height may be about three feet four inches, the width two
feet four inches, and the depth one foot four inches, inclosed
with folding doors, and provided with a good lock. The inside
to be partitioned down the middle, so as to admit of a range of
twelve square drawers on each side; under these, two or three
drawers may be fitted extending the whole width, to admit the
larger kinds of insects, such as the sphinges, cancri, &amp;c. the sides
and backs of all these drawers should be of cedar, and the fronts<span class="pagenum" id="Page694">[694]</span>
mahogany, with a brass ring or button to each. The cork with
which their bottoms are lined, must be chosen as free from cracks
as possible, and, after being washed several times with a solution
of corrosive sublimate in spirit of wine, to destroy the animalcula,
glued on to prevent its warping. The whole surface must be
made perfectly smooth and level, and this, as well as the sides,
covered with imperial paper carefully pasted on, and afterwards
moistened with alum-water. The paper should be exactly ruled
into squares proportioned to the size of the insects they are intended
to contain; and the names of each order and genus affixed
according to the system of Linn&aelig;us. By way of embellishment,
the edges may be lined all round the drawers with narrow slips
of some kind of ornamental paper. The fore-part of each drawer
should have a thin partition to admit of a proper quantity of
camphor, with a number of small air-holes for the more ready
diffusion of its effluvia to the insects contained in the drawer:
the tops of these partitions must be closed with thin slips of
wood laid on them and fitted with nicety, but not glued. To
prevent the admission of dust and air, and exhibit the contents
to advantage, the top of each drawer must be glazed with the
finest glass, fitted into a frame of the same size as the drawer,
made either to slide in a groove, or let in on a rabbet.</p>

<p>Having proceeded thus far, it will be adviseable to let the cabinet
be thoroughly aired, before any insects are deposited in it,
and to be particularly careful that all the insects so deposited be
as free as possible from moisture; if the cabinet be then constantly
kept in a dry situation, the camphor occasionally renewed, and
the air excluded, there is every reason to expect that the several
insects may be for a long time preserved in a state of perfection.
If, notwithstanding all these precautions, little dusty particles
should appear on any of the insects, which is a certain sign
of the presence of animalcula, they should be gently wiped with<span class="pagenum" id="Page695">[695]</span>
a hair pencil dipped in spirit of wine, or carefully removed into
a chip box and placed on the side of a Bath stove for a short
time; by these means, if early attended to, they will be sufficiently
baked to prevent future injury. A strict adherence to the
above particulars, enabled me to preserve the contents of the cabinet
formerly in my possession, now the property of Sir John
St. Aubyn, Bart. F. R. &amp; L. S. for several years in the most perfect
condition, though containing considerably above 2000 articles.
Within the same space of time, to my certain knowledge,
several valuable collections have been either totally destroyed, or
very materially injured; as when once the depredations commence,
the destruction proceeds with rapidity, if not speedily
prevented.</p>

<p>Those who are desirous of enriching their collection with the
productions of other climes, will require a cabinet much more
extensive, or, as the subject may be said to be inexhaustible, may
devote several to exotic insects only. The collection made by
Mr. Drury being, I believe, the most superb which has ever appeared
in this kingdom, it may prove agreeable to many of my
readers to give them a concise account of it. It is contained in
five large cabinets, and consists of two divisions; first, those
found in this country, and, secondly, those procured from various
quarters of the globe. The English collection contains 2324 different
insects, and the foreign one 5066; total, 7380: the latter
comprises of coleoptera, 1716; hemiptera, 676; lepidoptera, 1739;
neuroptera, 122; hymenoptera, 472; diptera, 312; aptera, 29.
The whole of this magnificent collection is regularly arranged,
according to the Linnean system, in 144 drawers. Some of the
most beautiful objects in this collection are exhibited and fully
described in a work published by Mr. Drury, in three vols.<span class="pagenum" id="Page696">[696]</span>
quarto, containing on 150 plates about 700 elegantly coloured
specimens.</p>

<p>The climate of Asia is particularly favourable to the production
of numerous articles in the several branches of natural history
unknown to, or not natives of Europe; especially those of
the lepidoptera order of insects, numbers of which are remarkably
large, and exhibit a variety of the most beautiful colours.
This induces gentlemen, previous to their departure for India, to
furnish themselves with cabinets at a considerable expense, anticipating
the satisfaction they shall enjoy during their residence
there, in arranging and depositing therein the several articles
they purpose collecting, and entertaining their friends with a
view of them. Besides this, they receive commissions from their
European friends to collect and remit to them as many as they
can, neither party conceiving that this would be attended with
any considerable degree of trouble or inconvenience. It may,
therefore, not be amiss to introduce here what the Rev. Mr. John,
one of the Danish missionaries at Tranquebar, says on the subject.<a href="#Footnote168" id="FNanchor168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
&#8220;The rainy season is in the highest degree injurious to
collections in every part of natural history, shells and minerals
excepted. To obtain a permanent cabinet, if not impossible, is
at least very difficult and expensive. Insects, unless carefully
preserved in close cases, well secured from the accession of the
smallest particle of air, are soon covered with mouldiness; nor
are dried fish, stuffed birds, skins of animals, plants, &amp;c. exempted
from this inconvenience; if not frequently exposed to the
rays of the sun or dried in ovens, myriads of animalcula in a
short time form a settlement and inevitably destroy them. All
the cabinets received from Europe, lined in the accustomed<span class="pagenum" id="Page697">[697]</span>
manner with cork or deal, are here on this account totally useless,
besides their being soon disjointed by the heat of the climate.
Sail cloth, well pitched and extended on frames, is far better calculated
to answer the purpose; a number of these may be placed
one above another, at a convenient distance, and the whole supported
on light feet: to render them more pleasant to the eye,
the linen may be covered as most agreeable either with white or
coloured paper. Even the echini, and the smaller marine plants,
attract so much dampness as to lose their colours and spicul&aelig;, and
fall to pieces, especially if they have not for some time been
previously soaked in fresh water, in order to deprive them of
their saline particles. Stuffed birds, &amp;c. lose their feathers or
hair, and the more soft and tender parts fall off. Consequently,
if no ships go from hence during the month of October, but are
detained till February, the major part of what I have collected
for such of my friends in Europe who are admirers of the wonderful
works of the Creator, will be lost to myself and them, besides
subjecting me to the imputation of a want of attention and
gratitude for favours previously received, than which nothing can
be farther from my heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>The above remarks, it is hoped, will afford some useful hints
to gentlemen intending to visit India; as well as plead in justification
of those who, unacquainted with the difficulty of preserving
collections in so warm a climate, have previous to their departure
precipitately made promises to their friends, which for
want of being realized, have too frequently exposed them to unmerited
censure.</p>

<p class="blankbefore2">In the introductory part to our author&#8217;s list of objects in
<a href="#Page600">Chap. X.</a> he very justly observes, that from the nature of the
subject the list must be very imperfect, &amp;c. it is not with the
vain idea of rendering that complete which he has left imperfect,
and which indeed must ever remain so, that the following general
list is introduced; but principally with the view of still farther
assisting the tyro, and pointing out a variety of articles,
that might not otherwise so readily occur to him. In most instances,
I have mentioned where the objects may be sought for
with a probability of success; to have described them would have
exceeded my limits. The specimen here given, will convince the
reader, that it would be no very difficult task, so to enlarge this
list, as to constitute a volume; but, it is presumed, that in its
present state it will be found sufficiently extensive, and of considerable
utility. To those who are already conversant with the
subject, it may prove acceptable as a kind of index to assist their
memories; and to such as may be disposed to form a cabinet, it
will serve the purposes of directing them in their choice of the
principal objects, and exhibiting some idea of the manner in
which they are to be arranged.</p>

<h4>III. VEGETABLES.</h4>

<p>Having thus enumerated a considerable variety of articles in
the animal and fossile kingdoms, the only part which remains to
be noticed is that of vegetables. To any person possessing but a
superficial knowledge of botany, it must be obvious that this
branch of natural history is extensive in the extreme; and that,
consequently, to point out but a small number of such plants as
form interesting objects for the microscope, would greatly extend
this list, already sufficiently large; for,</p>

<p>&#8220;How incompetent is human effort to portray the beauties of
this sublime subject! How inadequate the most descriptive talent
to approximate to our view the vegetative profusion contained
within the recess of nature! How limited have been our public
researches! How contracted the knowledge which has been as
yet obtained! What an incomprehensible store remains yet concealed,
impenetrable to mortal view!&#8221;<a href="#Footnote171" id="FNanchor171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote171"><a href="#FNanchor171" class="label">[171]</a> Observations
on the Structure and Economy of Plants, by R. Hooper, M. D., F. L. S.
page 128. This work contains an ingenious display of the analogy which subsists between the
animal and the vegetable kingdom.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>From a source so abundant, the botanist will be under no difficulty
in selecting for himself; those who have not made the
science a part of their studies, will be materially assisted by
having recource to the elegant figures and their descriptions in
the Botanical Magazine, by W. Curtis, F. L. S. the well-known
author of Flora Londinensis; and English Botany, by J. E. Smith,
M. D. F. R. &amp; Pres. L. S. published by Ja<sup>s</sup>. Sowerby, F. L. S.
I shall, therefore, just mention in general terms those parts of
plants which are peculiarly adapted for microscopical investigation.
These are as follow:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page709">[709]</span></p>

<ul class="objects">

<li>The trunk, composed of</li>

<li class="level2">Epidermis or cuticle</li>

<li class="level2">Cortex or outer bark</li>

<li class="level2">Liber or inner bark</li>

<li class="level2">Alburnum</li>

<li class="level2">Lignum or wood</li>

<li class="level2">Medulla or pith</li>

<li>The root cut transversely or longitudinally</li>

<li>Leaves and their fibres</li>

<li>The parts of fructification, consisting of</li>

<li class="level1">The calyx or flower cup</li>

<li class="level2">corolla or foliation, containing the leaves or petals, and the nectarium</li>

<li class="level2">stamina or threads, their filaments and anthera or summit, and the pollen contained
therein<a href="#Footnote172" id="FNanchor172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></li>

<li class="level1">The pistillum or pointal, its germen, style, and stigma</li>

<li class="level2">pericarpium, seed vessel, or germen grown to maturity</li>

<li class="level2">semina, seeds and their parts</li>

<li class="level2">receptaculum, the base on which the fructification is seated</li>

</ul>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote172"><a href="#FNanchor172" class="label">[172]</a> The pollen or meal is a fine dust
designed for the impregnation of the germen; a small quantity of this meal
being put into hot water and applied to the microscope, will exhibit the bursting of the elastic covering of each
grain; and the escape of the smaller atoms, which is the true farina.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Of the various classes of plants, that called cryptogamia is eminently
calculated for microscopical observation; comprizing the
filices, the musci, the alg&aelig;, and the fungi. On these subjects Hedwig
has produced a valuable work, entitled Theoria Generationis
et Fructificationis de Plantarum Cryptogamicarum, of which a new
and much improved edition has just appeared, and to which for
further information I refer the reader.</p>

</ul>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote173"><a href="#FNanchor173" class="label">[173]</a> To ascertain the true configurations
of salts, particular attention should be paid to obtain them genuine; it may
therefore be proper to apprize the reader, that some of those above enumerated are not easily procured in that state;
consequently, though they exhibit pleasing figures, yet they may not be those of the real salt purposed to be investigated.
Many hundred weights of some salts are annually manufactured, and sold under names very different from
what they really are. Nor is this circumstance confined to salts only: for want of botanical knowledge, preparations
of different plants have been frequently sold possessed of medical properties very different from those intended.
A valuable medicine, the extract of Hemlock, for instance, instead of being prepared of the conium maculatum,
has been made in large quantities of the ch&aelig;rophyllum sylvestre, and thus administered! On this unpleasant
subject I could enlarge, were it not digressing from that before us. Whilst such evils exist, need we
wonder if the physician as well as the patient are often disappointed in the beneficial effects expected from the adhibition
of medicines?</p>

<p>After having particularized so many of the works of <span class="smcapall">NATURE</span>,
let us now pay some attention to those of <span class="smcapall">ART</span>. But what an
humiliating contrast shall we meet with! If our design in viewing
objects by the microscope be to discover beauty, harmony,
and perfection, it will be necessary to limit our inquiries to the
former, happily alone sufficiently abundant; if, on the contrary,
we are desirous of discovering deformity and imperfection, we
must confine ourselves to the latter. Even those works of art
that appear to the unassisted eye as decisive proofs of consummate
skill in the workman, and which excite our admiration for
their apparent neatness and accuracy, when brought to this test,
exhibit their real state; and, consequently, tend but to display
the inferiority of the most finished performance of the ablest
artist, when put in competition with the glorious productions of
nature. The finest works of the loom and of the needle, if exhibited
with the microscope, prove so rude and coarse, that were
they to appear thus to the naked eye, so far from affording delight
to our belles, would be rejected with disgust. But the more we
inquire into the works of nature, the more fully are we satisfied
of their divine origin: in a flower, for instance, we see how fibres
too minute for the unassisted sight are composed of others still<span class="pagenum" id="Page712">[712]</span>
more minute, till the primordial threads or first principles are
utterly indiscernible; whilst the whole substance presents a
celestial radiance in its colouring, with a richness so superior to
silver or gold, as if it were intended for the cloathing of an angel,
and we have the highest authority for asserting, that the greatest
monarch of the East in all his glory, was not arrayed like one of
these. A very few specimens of art will, therefore, suffice.</p>

<ul class="objects">

<li>The edge of the sharpest razor or penknife</li>

<li>Teeth of rasps and files</li>

<li>Threads of the finest screws</li>

<li>Finest engravings on gold, silver, copper, &amp;c.</li>

<li>Coins, medals</li>

<li>Seals, intaglios</li>

<li>Best executed miniature paintings, prints, drawings, &amp;c.</li>

<li>The finest laces, silks, and ribbons</li>

<li>Smallest needles, pins, &amp;c.</li>

<li>Woolen and linen cloth, plain or printed; camblets, bombazeens, &amp;c.</li>

<li>A drop of ink on paper</li>

<li>Paper, from the coarsest to the finest</li>

<li>The writing of the ablest penman</li>

<li>The finest specimens of the typographic art, &amp;c. &amp;c.</li>

</ul>

<p>An inspection of a few of the above articles only will clearly
demonstrate, that as in the moral and political world, so in the
works of art, perfection is unattainable by mortal man. With
the fullest impression of which truth in the mind of the editor,
and an appeal to the candour of his readers towards those imperfections
which they may have discovered in this performance,
he shall now conclude with,</p>

<hr class="full" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page713">[713]</span></p>

<h2>ADDITIONS.</h2>

<p>The following is a new, useful, and ready method of making globules for microscopes,
differing from the customary one described in <a href="#Page8">page 8</a>, and is extracted from Mr. W. Nicholson&#8217;s
scientifical Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, and the Arts. No. 3, June 1, 1797. p. 134.</p>

<p>&#8220;The usual method has been to draw out a fine thread of the soft white glass called crystal,
and to convert the extremity of this into a spherule by melting it at the flame of a candle. But
this glass contains lead, which is disposed to become opake by partial reduction, unless the
management be very carefully attended to. I find that the hard glass used for windows seldom
fails to afford excellent spherules. This glass is of a clear bright green colour when seen edgeways.
A thin piece was cut from the edge of a pane of glass less than one-tenth of an inch
broad. This was held perpendicularly by the upper end, and the flame of a candle was directed
upon it by the blow-pipe at the distance of about an inch from the lower end. The glass became
soft, and the lower piece descended by its own weight to the distance of about two feet,
where it remained suspended by a thin thread of glass about one five-hundredth of an inch in
diameter. A part of this thread was applied endways to the lower blue part of the flame of the
candle without the use of the blow-pipe. The extremity immediately became white-hot, and
formed a globule. The glass was then gradually and regularly thrust towards the flame, but
never into it, until the globule was sufficiently large. A number of these were made, and being
afterwards examined by viewing their focal images with a deeper magnifier, proved very bright,
perfect, and round.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The opake solar microscope has been made by the late Mr. Martin of larger dimensions than
described in <a href="#Page106">page 106</a>. The illuminating lens, at A B,
<a href="#Plate5">Plate V.</a> Fig. 1, and the breadth of the mirror
were about four inches and an half, instead of three inches, which gives more than double the light
of the former; and, consequently, all the larger sort of opake and transparent objects, to the size
of one and an half or two inches in diameter, as well as diverting objects painted on glass, like
the magic lanthorn sliders, are shewn with the greatest distinctness, and has by Mr. Martin been
called the <span class="smcapall">MEGALASCOPE</span> of the apparatus.</p>

<p>The same ingenious and learned artist applied a lattice of small squares about one-tenth of an
inch, each square made of fine wire, or lines drawn strongly on glass in a circle of one inch in
diameter, and placed these in the compound body of a microscope or telescope, in the focus of
the glasses next to the eye. And having a copper-plate lattice of squares disposed into a
circle, and to any size as may be wanted, the observer or artist may then with great facility
make an exact drawing on the paper of the object observed. The same contrivance is applicable
to the solar microscope. This he called the <span class="smcapall">GRAPHICAL MICROSCOPE OR PERSPECTIVE</span>.</p>

<p><a href="#Page127">Page 127</a>, line 24&mdash;Any pocket telescope, the drawers of which are made to allow of a further
extension than usual, may be used as a compound microscope for examining birds or insects
alive, in a garden on the flowers, shrubberies, &amp;c. from a window near to the objects. There are
few pocket achromatic telescopes or perspectives, but what will define and magnify objects from
about six feet to any distance from the instrument. The magnifying power is inversely as the
distance of the object from the telescope, and, consequently variable in an infinite degree; on
which account Mr. Martin named it the <span class="smcapall">POLYDYNAMIC MICROSCOPE</span>.</p>

<h2>Transcriber&#8217;s Notes</h2>

<p>Depending on the hard- and software used to read this text and their settins, not all elements may displayed as intended.</p>

<p>Archaic, unusual and inconsistent spelling, grammar and sentence constructions have been retained; accents etc. for French and German
have not been corrected unless listed below.</p>

<p>Paragraph numbering has been retained, also when this was not serving any obvious purpose and/or was not contiguous.</p>

<p>The use of italicised and non-italicised reference letters in the text has not been standardised.</p>

<p>The hierarchy in (sub-)section headings has been based on the text, due to the absence of a detailed table of contents and lack of
visible differences between the various levels of (sub-)section headings in the source document.</p>

<p>The plates were originally bound separate from the text, but in the source document used they were bound together with the text. Due
to the way of binding parts of most plates are invisible and discoloured near and in the gutter. Captions and credits in and around the
plates have been reconstructed as far as possible.</p>

<p>Larger versions of the plates may not be available in all file formats, but may be accessed through the browser version available at
www.gutenberg.org. In the descriptions of individual items hyperlinks have only been provided to the Plates, not to individual figures in
the plates.</p>

<h3>Changes made</h3>

<p>Footnotes have been moved to under the text to which they belong. Where necessary, page numbers in references to footnotes have been
adjusted accordingly.</p>

in references has been replaced with the actual title.</p>
